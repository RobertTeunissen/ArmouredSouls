# Armoured Souls — Type System Proposal (Step 1)

## Purpose
This document proposes **two viable typographic systems** for Armoured Souls.

Each system is evaluated against:
- Direction B (Precision / Engineering)
- Direction C (Soul / Energy)
- Direction D (Minimal / Scaling)
- Long-term UX and web-app viability
- Explicit exclusion of anime and fantasy semiotics

The goal is to select **one system** that will underpin:
- Logos
- UI typography
- Icon geometry
- Motion and spacing logic

---

## Evaluation Criteria

A valid type system for Armoured Souls must:

1. Express **mastery and control** without feeling cold
2. Allow **contained emotional activation** (Direction C)
3. Scale down cleanly for dense UI and icons
4. Remain legible in a web-based application
5. Avoid anime, sci-fi cliché, and fantasy signaling
6. Age well over multiple years of development

---

## System A — Industrial Precision (Recommended)

### Display / Logo Font
**DIN Condensed / DIN Next / Inter Tight (customised)**

*(Exact font can be licensed or substituted; the system matters more than the vendor.)*

#### Why this works
- Engineered, utilitarian origins
- Strong association with control systems, machinery, logistics
- Neutral enough to carry meaning without imposing it
- Excellent numeric clarity

#### Direction Alignment
- **B (Precision):** Excellent  
  Clean geometry, rational spacing, mechanical confidence
- **C (Soul):** Good when modified  
  Inner glow, energy cores, and subtle distortion can live *inside* the rigid form
- **D (Minimal):** Excellent  
  Reduces cleanly to monograms and flat marks

#### Visual Characteristics
- Condensed proportions → authority, efficiency
- High x-height → UI legibility
- Straight terminals → discipline
- Predictable rhythm → mastery

---

### UI / Body Font
**Inter / Source Sans 3 / IBM Plex Sans**

#### Rationale
- Designed for interfaces
- Excellent readability at small sizes
- Neutral tone supports management fantasy
- Strong number rendering (critical for stats, economy, upgrades)

---

### System A — Strengths
- Feels *professional* and *serious*
- Reinforces mastery and pride
- Supports long play sessions without fatigue
- Naturally avoids anime and fantasy cues
- Works extremely well for dashboards and data-heavy screens

### System A — Risks
- If left completely unmodified, may feel too cold
- Requires Direction C treatment to surface “soul”

**Mitigation:**  
Soul is expressed through *treatment*, not type shape.

---

## System B — Engineered Expression

### Display / Logo Font
**Eurostile / Bank Gothic–style system (modernised)**

#### Why this works
- Strong historic association with machinery and sci-fi *without anime*
- Squared forms communicate robustness
- Feels more aggressive and characterful out of the box

#### Direction Alignment
- **B (Precision):** Good  
  Strong, but less neutral than System A
- **C (Soul):** Very good  
  Expressiveness is easier to activate
- **D (Minimal):** Moderate  
  Can become heavy or noisy at small sizes

#### Visual Characteristics
- Squared counters
- Broad stance
- High visual weight
- Strong presence

---

### UI / Body Font
**Inter / IBM Plex Sans (mandatory pairing)**

A more expressive display font requires a very neutral UI font to compensate.

---

### System B — Strengths
- Immediate character
- Strong arena presence
- Less work to “feel powerful”

### System B — Risks
- Can overpower the UX
- Harder to scale into minimal contexts
- Higher risk of drifting into genre cliché if misused

---

## Direct Comparison

| Criterion | System A | System B |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Precision / Mastery | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Pride (subtle) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| UI Scalability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Minimal Icon Support | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Long-term Brand Safety | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Anime Risk | None | Low–Moderate |

---

## Recommendation

**Choose System A — Industrial Precision.**

Reasoning:
- Armoured Souls is a **long-lived system**, not a one-off experience
- Mastery and pride emerge over time
- Emotional peaks should be *activated*, not constant
- System A gives you a stable spine that Direction C can bend without breaking

System B is viable, but higher-risk and less future-proof.

---

## Decision Required

Select **one**:

- **Option A:** Industrial Precision (recommended)
- **Option B:** Engineered Expression

Once selected:
- Typography becomes locked
- Logo construction begins
- All further visual work derives from this choice

---

## Out of Scope (Next Step)

- Logo geometry construction
- Direction B / C / D logo execution
- Icon grid derivation
- Motion and glow rules

These follow immediately after selection.
