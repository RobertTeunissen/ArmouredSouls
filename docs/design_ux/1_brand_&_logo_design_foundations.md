# Armoured Souls — Brand & Logo Design Foundations

## Purpose of this Document
This document defines the **brand logic, emotional axis, and logo system** for *Armoured Souls*.  
It is not a style guide yet; it is the **design rationale** that all future visual decisions must align with.

---

## Core Brand Premise

**Armoured Souls** is a **system-driven robot combat management game**.

The player is not the robot.  
The player is the **manager**.

Like a cycling team manager:
- They build a stable their own way
- They make trade-offs
- They optimise, specialise, and commit
- Different successful players pursue different strategies

Success is not uniform — **ownership and mastery are**.

---

## Primary Player Fantasy

> *“I built this stable deliberately, and it reflects who I am as a manager.”*

Key implications:
- There is no single optimal path
- Identity emerges from constraints
- Pride comes from decisions, not spectacle

---

## The Meaning of “Soul”

The concept of *soul* is **dual and literal**:

1. **The Manager’s Soul**
   - Passion for optimisation
   - Identity expressed through systems
   - Emotional investment in long-term success

2. **The Robot’s Soul**
   - More than hardware
   - A persistent entity shaped by use, upgrades, and history
   - Exists *for* the manager, and *because of* the manager

This duality must be reflected visually:
- Not sentimental
- Not anime
- Subtle, contained, internal

---

## Dominant Emotional Targets

The brand must primarily evoke:

- **Mastery**
- **Pride**

Secondary emotions (allowed but subordinate):
- Control
- Ownership
- Belonging

Excluded emotional tones:
- Whimsy
- Chaos
- Spectacle-for-spectacle’s-sake
- Anime expressiveness

---

## Logo System Strategy (Not a Single Logo)

Armoured Souls requires a **logo hierarchy**, not a single universal mark.

The brand is expressed through **three coordinated logo directions**, each with a specific role.

---

## Direction B — Precision / Engineering (CORE)

### Role
The **primary identity** of Armoured Souls.

### Represents
- Systems thinking
- Optimisation
- Trade-offs
- Control
- Managerial authority

### Visual Principles
- Engineered, angular letterforms
- Controlled geometry and spacing
- Disciplined metallic materials (brushed, matte)
- Minimal ornamentation
- No emotional excess

### Usage
- App shell / navbar
- Dashboard
- Stable management
- Facilities
- Economy, contracts, progression

### Message to Player
> “You are in control.  
> Success here is earned through mastery.”

This logo must age well and remain calm under constant exposure.

---

## Direction C — Soul / Energy (HEART)

### Role
The **emotional amplifier**, derived from Direction B.

### Represents
- Bond between manager and robots
- Emotional investment
- Identity beyond efficiency
- Pride at moments of consequence

### Visual Principles
- Energy contained *within* the form
- Inner glow, not outer glow
- Subtle irregularities allowed
- Mechanical structure remains visible

### Usage
- Arena entry
- Match start
- Victory / defeat screens
- Major milestones and achievements

### Message to Player
> “This machine fights for you.”

Important constraint:
- Direction C never replaces Direction B in management contexts
- It activates emotion, it does not define structure

---

## Direction D — Minimal / Icon-First (SCALING)

### Role
The **deployment and scalability identity**.

### Represents
- Confidence
- Maturity
- Longevity
- Professionalism

### Visual Principles
- Reduced mark or monogram
- Flat or near-flat rendering
- High contrast
- Texture-independent
- Geometry derived from Direction B

### Usage
- Login screen (compact)
- Loading states
- Responsive headers
- Favicon
- Dense UI contexts

### Message to Player
> “You are entering an established system.”

---

## What the Brand Explicitly Is Not

- Anime-inspired
- Cartoony
- Fantasy-RPG coded
- Mobile-gacha coded
- Overly cinematic
- Expressive at the cost of clarity

---

## Design North Star

When in doubt, any brand or logo decision should answer:

> “Does this reinforce mastery, pride, and deliberate ownership —  
> or does it distract from them?”

If it distracts, it is wrong.

---

## Next Step (Out of Scope for This Document)

- Selection of a **type system** that can support B, C, and D
- Construction of the first **logo family** from that system
- Derivation of iconography and UI usage rules

This document is the foundation those steps must build upon.
