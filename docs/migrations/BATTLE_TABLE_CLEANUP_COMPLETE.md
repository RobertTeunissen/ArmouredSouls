# Battle Table Cleanup - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully removed all old per-robot columns from the Battle table. The system now exclusively uses the BattleParticipant table for per-robot battle data.

## Migration Status

### Schema Changes
- ✅ Removed old columns from `schema.prisma`:
  - `robot1PrestigeAwarded`, `robot2PrestigeAwarded`
  - `robot1FameAwarded`, `robot2FameAwarded`
  - `robot1FinalHP`, `robot2FinalHP`
  - `robot1Yielded`, `robot2Yielded`
  - `robot1Destroyed`, `robot2Destroyed`
  - `robot1DamageDealt`, `robot2DamageDealt`

- ✅ Migration file created: `20260220201630_remove_old_battle_columns/migration.sql`
- ⏳ Migration not yet applied (database not running)

### Code Changes

#### Battle Orchestrators (Write Operations)
All battle orchestrators now write ONLY to BattleParticipant table:

1. **battleOrchestrator.ts** ✅
   - `createBattleRecord()` - Creates BattleParticipant records with all per-robot data
   - `updateRobotStats()` - Reads from BattleParticipant to update robot stats
   - Audit log creation - Reads from BattleParticipant for event data
   - Removed Battle.update() that wrote prestige/fame to old columns

2. **tournamentBattleOrchestrator.ts** ✅
   - `createTournamentBattleRecord()` - Creates BattleParticipant records
   - `updateRobotStatsForTournament()` - Reads from BattleParticipant
   - Audit log creation - Reads from BattleParticipant
   - Fixed duplicate property in Battle.create()

3. **tagTeamBattleOrchestrator.ts** ✅
   - `executeBattle()` - Creates BattleParticipant records for all 4 robots
   - Removed writes to old Battle columns in battle creation
   - Removed writes to old columns in bye-match handling

#### API Routes (Read Operations)
All routes now read from BattleParticipant table:

1. **matches.ts** ✅
   - Battle history endpoint includes `participants`
   - Reads finalHP, ELO, damage from BattleParticipant

2. **robots.ts** ✅
   - Robot battle history includes `participants`
   - Battle stats helper reads from BattleParticipant
   - Supports 1v1 and tag team battles

3. **admin.ts** ✅
   - Admin dashboard statistics read from BattleParticipant
   - Battle list endpoint includes `participants`
   - Kill count calculation uses BattleParticipant.destroyed

4. **records.ts** ✅ (Already fixed in previous session)
   - Hall of Records queries BattleParticipant directly

#### Services
1. **robotPerformanceService.ts** ✅ (Already fixed in previous session)
   - All analytics methods read from BattleParticipant

2. **cycleSnapshotService.ts** ✅ (Already correct)
   - Uses AuditLog as single source of truth
   - Does NOT read from Battle or BattleParticipant tables

## Data Flow

### Battle Creation (Single Write)
```
Battle Orchestrators
  ↓
Write to:
  1. Battle table (core battle info: IDs, winner, rewards, ELO tracking, battleLog)
  2. BattleParticipant table (per-robot data: HP, damage, prestige, fame, streaming)
  3. AuditLog (battle_complete events for cycle snapshots)
```

### Battle Queries (Read from BattleParticipant)
```
API Endpoints
  ↓
Read from BattleParticipant table:
  - finalHP, damageDealt, yielded, destroyed
  - eloBefore, eloAfter
  - prestigeAwarded, fameAwarded
  - streamingRevenue
  - credits
```

### Cycle Snapshots (Read from AuditLog)
```
cycleSnapshotService
  ↓
Read from AuditLog (battle_complete events)
  - Single source of truth
  - No dependency on Battle or BattleParticipant tables
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Cleaner Schema** - Battle table no longer has robot1/robot2 columns
2. **Consistent Structure** - Same schema for all battle types (1v1, tournament, tag team)
3. **Better Queries** - Direct participant lookups without OR conditions
4. **Complete Data** - Streaming revenue included per participant
5. **Future-Proof** - Can support N-player battles
6. **No Duplication** - Single source of truth for per-robot battle data

## Next Steps

### To Apply Migration:
1. Start the database: `docker-compose up -d` (or your database startup command)
2. Apply migration: `cd app/backend && npx prisma migrate deploy`
3. Verify: `npx prisma migrate status`

### To Test:
1. Start backend: `npm run dev`
2. Run a cycle with battles
3. Verify:
   - Battle reports show all data correctly
   - Hall of Records displays correctly
   - Robot analytics work
   - Cycle snapshots aggregate correctly
   - Admin dashboard shows correct statistics
