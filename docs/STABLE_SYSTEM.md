# Stable System

**Last Updated**: January 30, 2026  
**Status**: Design Document

## Overview

A **Stable** is the player's collection and management system for their robots. Each user has one stable where they manage Credits, Prestige, facility upgrades, and their robot roster.

**Database Schema**: See DATABASE_SCHEMA.md for authoritative field definitions and relationships.

---

## Stable-Level Attributes

### Core Resources

**Credits (₡)** - Primary currency
- Starting balance: ₡2,000,000 (increased to accommodate facility system)
- Used for: Robot purchases, upgrades, weapons, repairs, facility upgrades
- Earned from: Battles, tournaments, achievements, daily income streams

**Prestige** - Stable reputation and ranking
- Starting prestige: 0
- Separate from individual robot fame
- Represents overall stable success and history
- **Never spent** - Used only to unlock content
- Unlocks: Facility levels, tournaments, exclusive equipment, cosmetic options
- Earned from: Tournament wins, high rankings, achievements, robot milestones

### Stable Statistics

Statistics are captured at both stable-level and robot-level for comprehensive tracking:

**Stable-Level Statistics** (Aggregated from all robots):
- **Total Battles**: Lifetime battle count across all robots
- **Total Wins**: Victory count across all robots
- **Win Rate**: Overall stable win percentage (calculated: totalWins / totalBattles × 100)
- **Championship Titles**: Tournament victories
- **Active Robots**: Current roster size
- **Highest ELO**: Best ELO achieved by any robot in the stable

**Robot-Level Statistics** (Individual robot performance):
- See ROBOT_ATTRIBUTES.md for complete list
- Individual robot ELO, battles, wins, losses
- Damage dealt/taken lifetime
- Fame, league tier, league points
- Kills, titles

**Aggregation Strategy**:
- Stable statistics are aggregates (sums/averages) of robot statistics
- Individual robot stats drive rankings and matchmaking
- Stable stats used for prestige calculations and leaderboards
- Both levels tracked for complete performance picture

---

## Facility System

Players invest Credits in facility upgrades that provide stable-wide benefits. All facilities have **10 levels** (Level 0 = not purchased, Levels 1-10 = upgrades). Some facility levels require prestige thresholds to unlock.

**Bonus Stacking**: Coaching Staff bonuses are **additive** with Loadout and Stance percentage modifiers. See [ROBOT_ATTRIBUTES.md](ROBOT_ATTRIBUTES.md#effective-stat-calculation) for the complete formula:
```
effective_attribute = (base + weapon_bonuses) × (1 + loadout% + stance% + coach%)

Example:
  Combat Power base: 20
  Weapon bonuses: +5
  Two-Handed loadout: +25%
  Offensive stance: +15%
  Offensive Coach (Level 8): +7%
  
  effective = (20 + 5) × (1 + 0.25 + 0.15 + 0.07)
           = 25 × 1.47
           = 36.75 → 37 (rounded)

---

## Daily Income/Expense System

The game presents players with a **daily income/expense sheet** showing all revenue streams and operating costs.

### Revenue Streams

**Battle Winnings**:
- Win rewards vary by league tier
- Bronze: ₡5,000 - ₡10,000 per win
- Silver: ₡10,000 - ₡20,000 per win
- Gold: ₡20,000 - ₡40,000 per win
- Platinum: ₡40,000 - ₡80,000 per win
- Diamond: ₡80,000 - ₡150,000 per win
- Champion: ₡150,000 - ₡300,000 per win

**Prestige Bonuses**:

- 10,000+ Prestige: +10% to battle winnings
- 25,000+ Prestige: +15% to battle winnings
- 50,000+ Prestige: +20% to battle winnings

**Merchandising** (from Income Generator facility):
```
merchandising_income = base_merchandising × (1 + prestige / 10000)

Example:
- Income Generator Level 4: ₡12,000/day base
- Prestige 15,000
- Merchandising = ₡12,000 × (1 + 15000/10000) = ₡12,000 × 2.5 = ₡30,000/day
```

**Streaming Revenue** (from Income Generator facility):
```
streaming_income = base_streaming × (1 + (total_battles / 1000)) × (1 + (total_fame / 5000))

// total_battles = aggregate of all robot battles in stable
// total_fame = sum of fame values from all robots in stable

Example:
- Income Generator Level 5: ₡6,000/day base
- Total battles: 500 (across all robots)
- Total fame: 10,000 (sum of all robot fame values)
- Streaming = ₡6,000 × (1 + 0.5) × (1 + 2.0) = ₡6,000 × 1.5 × 3.0 = ₡27,000/day
```

### Operating Costs

**Facility Operating Costs**:
- Each facility has daily operating cost (see facility descriptions)
- Costs increase with facility level
- Total daily operating cost = sum of all active facility costs

**Repair Costs**:
- Robots damaged in battle require repairs
- Repair costs based on damage taken and attribute total (see ROBOT_ATTRIBUTES.md)
- Not a daily cost - only after battles

**Coach Costs**:
- Active coach costs ₡3,000/day (if Coaching Staff facility upgraded)
- Switching coaches costs ₡100,000 one-time

## Progression Strategy

### Early Game (₡2M starting budget)
1. Build 1 robot with basic weapon (₡500K + ₡150K = ₡650K)
2. Upgrade key attributes (₡300K)
3. Save for Repair Bay Level 1 (₡200K) - reduces long-term costs
4. Focus on battles to earn Credits and prestige
5. Remaining: ~₡850K for additional upgrades or second robot

**Viable Alternative**: 
- Build 2 robots (₡1M) with cheap weapons (₡200K total)
- Leaves ₡800K for initial upgrades and facility
- Riskier but allows testing different builds

### Mid Game (₡5M+ total earned)
1. Upgrade key facilities (Repair Bay, Training Facility to Level 3-4)
2. Expand robot roster to 3-4 robots
3. Unlock Income Generator for passive income
4. Specialize robots for different strategies
5. Invest in better weapons (₡300K-₡400K range)
6. Participate in Silver/Gold tournaments

### Late Game (₡20M+ total earned)
1. Max out critical facilities (Repair Bay, Medical Bay, all 4 Training Academies)
2. Build specialized arena teams
3. Invest in prestige-locked content (high-tier tournaments)
4. Compete in high-tier tournaments (Diamond/Champion)
5. Build legendary custom weapons
6. Optimize daily income streams (Income Generator Level 10)

## Economic Balance

**Starting Phase**:
- ₡2,000,000 starting Credits (increased from ₡1M)
- Can afford: 1 robot (₡500K) + good weapon (₡300K) + upgrades (₡500K) + facility (₡200K) = ₡1.5M, leaving ₡500K buffer
- Or: 2 robots (₡1M) + basic weapons (₡200K each) + minimal upgrades (₡400K) + facility (₡200K) = ₡2M exactly

**Facility Investment Payoff** (estimated):
- Repair Bay Level 1: Pays for itself after ~40 battles (₡200K / ₡5K avg savings per battle)
- Training Facility Level 1: Pays for itself after upgrading ~600 attribute levels (₡300K / ₡500 avg savings)
- Income Generator Level 1: Pays for itself after ~27 days (₡800K / (₡5K/day - ₡1K/day operating))
- Weapons Workshop Level 1: Pays for itself after buying ~8 weapons (₡250K / ₡30K avg savings per weapon)

**Prestige Unlocks**:
- Encourage long-term play
- Provide goals beyond Credits
- Create aspirational content (World Championship at 50,000 prestige)
- Reward consistent performance

**Operating Costs**:
- Scale with facility levels (~₡20K-₡40K/day for mid-game stable)
- Balanced by income streams (₡30K-₡60K/day from battles + passive income)
- Creates strategic decisions (which facilities to upgrade vs operating cost burden)
