## Design Philosophy & Brand Alignment

### Core Brand Premise

**Armoured Souls is a system-driven robot combat management game.**

The player is **not** the robot. The player is **the manager**.

Like a cycling team manager, players:
- Build their stable their own way
- Make strategic trade-offs
- Optimize, specialize, and commit to long-term strategies
- Express identity through systems mastery

### Primary Player Fantasy

> *"I built this stable deliberately, and it reflects who I am as a manager."*

### Brand Emotional Targets

**Primary Emotions** (must dominate):
- **Mastery** - Players feel competent and in control
- **Pride** - Players take ownership of their strategic decisions

**Secondary Emotions** (supporting):
- Control
- Ownership
- Belonging

**Excluded Emotions** (must avoid):
- Whimsy, chaos, spectacle-for-spectacle's-sake
- Anime expressiveness
- Fantasy RPG tropes
- Mobile gacha aesthetics

### Design North Star

> "Does this reinforce mastery, pride, and deliberate ownership — or does it distract from them?"

If it distracts, it is wrong.

## Emotional Design Strategy

### The Three Logo States & Their Meaning

Armoured Souls uses **logo hierarchy** to signal context and stakes:

#### Direction B — Precision/Engineering (CORE)
- **Context**: Management screens, stable operations, economy
- **Emotional Target**: Control, mastery, managerial authority
- **Visual Treatment**: Engineered letterforms, minimal ornamentation, brushed metal
- **Usage**: Navigation, dashboard, facilities, upgrades, robot management

#### Direction C — Soul/Energy (HEART)
- **Context**: Arena entry, match start, victory/defeat, major milestones
- **Emotional Target**: Emotional bond, pride, significance
- **Visual Treatment**: Inner glow (never outer), energy contained within form
- **Usage**: Battle screens, achievements, promotions, championships

#### Direction D — Minimal/Icon (SCALING)
- **Context**: Infrastructure, loading, login, dense UI
- **Emotional Target**: Confidence, professionalism, maturity
- **Visual Treatment**: Reduced mark, flat rendering, high contrast
- **Usage**: Login screen, loading states, favicon, responsive headers

### Emotional Escalation Ladder

| User Journey Stage | Logo State | Emotional Weight | Design Approach |
|-------------------|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Entry/Infrastructure | D | Neutral | Calm, professional |
| Management/Planning | B | Controlled | Systematic, clear |
| Pre-Battle Focus | B → C | Rising Stakes | Subtle activation |
| Battle/Resolution | C | Peak Emotion | Brief, decisive |
| Return to Planning | C → B | Settling | Return to control |

**Critical Rule**: Direction C is **earned**, not constant. Emotional peaks must be brief to remain meaningful.

## Visual Hierarchy System

### Information Architecture Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Dashboard: High-level overview
   - Detail Pages: Comprehensive information
   - Modals: Context-specific actions

2. **Task-Oriented Organization**
   - Pages organized around player goals, not arbitrary categories
   - Pre-Battle Flow: Configure → Battle → Results → Adjust
   - Progression Flow: Upgrades → Facilities
   - Management Flow: Shop → Inventory → Equipment

3. **Contextual Information**
   - Critical data visible without navigation (Credits in header)
   - Robot HP status always visible on cards
   - Storage capacity shown during purchasing

4. **Consistent Navigation**
   - Main nav present on all pages
   - Breadcrumbs for hierarchy (future)
   - Quick actions on cards for common tasks

## Motion & Micro-Animations

### Core Motion Philosophy

Motion in Armoured Souls is:
- **Deliberate** - Responds to user action or system state
- **Contained** - Energy is internal, not explosive
- **Earned** - Emotional peaks are brief and meaningful

**If motion draws attention to itself, it is wrong.**

### Motion States

#### 1. Infrastructure Motion (Direction D)
- **Context**: Login, loading, empty states
- **Duration**: 200-300ms
- **Easing**: Linear fades
- **Rules**: No scale changes, no bounce

#### 2. Management Motion (Direction B)
- **Context**: Stable overview, robot lists, facilities
- **Duration**: 150-250ms
- **Easing**: Ease-out
- **Rules**: Subtle transitions, minimal movement (2-6px)

#### 3. Focused Interaction Motion (B → C)
- **Context**: Pre-battle, arena entry, match start
- **Duration**: 250-400ms
- **Easing**: Ease-out
- **Rules**: One directional movement, slight scale-in (≤1.05×)

#### 4. Resolution Motion (Direction C)
- **Context**: Victory, defeat, promotions, major unlocks
- **Duration**: 400-600ms
- **Easing**: Ease-out
- **Rules**: Brief expressive beat, settles quickly, no looping

### Logo Motion Rules

**Allowed**:
- Fade in/out
- Scale-in (≤5%)
- Inner glow ramp-up
- Opacity-based reveal

**Forbidden**:
- Rotation
- Bounce
- Elastic easing
- Continuous pulsing
- Particle effects
- Screen shake

### UI Component Animations

| Component | Animation | Duration | Trigger |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Button Hover | Slight lift (2px) | 150ms | Mouse enter |
| Card Hover | Shadow expansion | 200ms | Mouse enter |
| Modal Open | Fade + scale-in | 250ms | Modal trigger |
| HP Bar Update | Smooth fill transition | 300ms | Data change |
| Notification | Slide-in from top | 300ms | Event |
| Loading Spinner | Continuous rotation | - | Loading state |

### Accessibility

- **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`**: Replace movement with fades
- **Remove scale changes** in reduced motion mode
- **Keep durations short**: Never delay user input
