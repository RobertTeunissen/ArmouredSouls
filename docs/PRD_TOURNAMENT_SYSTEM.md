## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for implementing a **Tournament System** for Armoured Souls. The tournament system introduces a new competitive format alongside the existing league battles, enabling robots to compete in structured elimination events with enhanced rewards and prestige.

**Key Features:**
- **Tournament Framework**: Flexible architecture supporting multiple concurrent tournaments with various formats
- **Single Elimination Tournament**: First tournament type where all available robots compete in knockout rounds
- **Automatic Progression**: Tournaments run continuously - when one completes, a new one begins
- **Admin Integration**: Triggerable manually or as part of the daily cycle
- **Financial Integration**: Full compliance with existing economy system (participation credits, win rewards, streaming income)
- **Battle Variety**: New "tournament" battle type alongside "league" battles

**Success Criteria**: Players can participate in tournaments alongside league battles, view tournament brackets and progress, earn enhanced rewards for tournament victories, and experience continuous competitive events that drive engagement.

---

## Background & Context

### Current State

**What Exists:**
- ✅ Complete battle system with combat simulator
- ✅ Matchmaking and scheduling system for league battles
- ✅ Financial system with battle rewards, operating costs, and income streams
- ✅ Battle types: Currently only "league" battles
- ✅ ScheduledMatch model for upcoming battles
- ✅ Battle model with complete tracking (damage, ELO, rewards, battle logs)
- ✅ Admin endpoints for daily cycle management
- ✅ Robot battle readiness system (HP, weapons, yield threshold)

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Tournament framework architecture
- ❌ Tournament bracket/pairing logic
- ❌ Tournament state management (rounds, progression)
- ❌ Tournament-specific battle rewards
- ❌ Tournament display UI (brackets, progress)
- ❌ Multiple upcoming match support per robot
- ❌ Tournament history tracking

### Why Tournaments Matter

Tournaments provide:
- **Narrative Structure**: Clear beginning, middle, and end with climactic finals
- **Enhanced Rewards**: Higher stakes battles with bigger payouts
- **Prestige Opportunities**: Championship titles and fame accumulation
- **Engagement Driver**: Continuous competitive events maintain player interest
- **Strategic Depth**: Different optimal strategies for tournament vs. league play
- **Community Building**: Shared tournament experiences create player stories

The continuous tournament model ensures:
- **Always-On Competition**: Players always have tournament opportunities
- **No Downtime**: Seamless transition between tournament cycles
- **Multiple Match Types**: Robots can have both league and tournament matches scheduled

---

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Flexible Tournament Framework**: Support multiple concurrent tournaments with different formats
2. **Single Elimination Implementation**: First tournament type with knockout progression
3. **Seamless Integration**: Works alongside existing league battles without conflicts
4. **Enhanced Rewards**: Tournament victories provide greater rewards than league battles
5. **Admin Control**: Tournaments triggerable manually and via daily cycle automation

### Success Metrics

- Tournaments successfully run alongside league battles without scheduling conflicts
- Robots can have multiple upcoming matches (league + tournament)
- Tournament brackets properly handle odd numbers of participants (bye matches)
- Financial rewards correctly calculated and awarded (participation, wins, streaming)
- Tournament battles appear in battle history with proper categorization
- Admin can manually trigger tournaments and include in daily cycle
- Tournament state persists correctly across rounds
- Winner determination and new tournament creation work automatically

--> Robots need to be repaired after each battle in (cycle) simulation. What happens if a robot is not repaired (ie. not considered battle ready)?


### Non-Goals (Out of Scope for Initial Release)

- **Team tournaments (2v2, 3v3)**: Future feature, not in initial release
- **Swiss-style tournaments**: Single elimination only for now
- **Player-created tournaments**: Admin-only in Phase 1
- **Tournament bracketing UI**: Simple list view initially, full brackets later
- **Tournament registration system**: All available robots auto-enter
- **Prize pools**: Fixed rewards initially, prize pools in future versions

---

## User Stories & Requirements

### Epic 1: Tournament Framework

**As a developer**, I need a flexible tournament framework so that multiple tournament types can run concurrently.

#### User Story 1.1: Tournament Model
- **As a developer**, I need a Tournament database model to track tournament state
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Tournament model includes: id, name, tournamentType, status, currentRound, maxRounds, createdAt, startedAt, completedAt, winnerId
  - Tournament statuses: "pending", "active", "completed"
  - Tournament types: "single_elimination" (extensible for future types)
  - Can query active tournaments
  - Can track tournament progression through rounds
 
--> Need to know what round we're currently in and when the next tournament would start (important for new robots a manager might want to buy)

#### User Story 1.2: Tournament Match Model
- **As a developer**, I need a TournamentMatch model to track individual tournament battles
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Links to parent Tournament
  - Includes: round number, match number in round, robot1Id, robot2Id, winnerId, battleId
  - Supports bye matches (one robot, no opponent)
  - Can query matches by tournament and round
  - Links to Battle record after execution
 
#### User Story 1.3: Multiple Tournaments
- **As a system**, I need to support multiple concurrent tournaments
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Multiple tournaments can be "active" simultaneously
  - Tournaments don't interfere with each other's progression
  - Each tournament tracks its own state independently
  - Different tournament types can run concurrently

### Epic 2: Single Elimination Tournament

**As a player**, I want to compete in single elimination tournaments so that I can earn prestige and test my robot against all competitors.

#### User Story 2.1: Tournament Creation
- **As an admin**, I can create a new single elimination tournament
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Tournament includes all battle-ready robots (HP ≥75%, weapons equipped)
  - Excludes bye-robot and robots already in active tournaments
  - Excludes robots with scheduled league matches (conflict avoidance)
  - Generates initial bracket with proper seeding (by ELO)
  - Handles odd numbers with bye matches in first round
  - Sets tournament to "active" status
 
#### User Story 2.2: Bracket Generation
- **As a system**, I need to generate proper single elimination brackets
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Seeds robots by ELO rating (highest vs lowest)
  - Calculates correct number of rounds: ceil(log2(participants))
  - First round pairs: #1 vs #16, #8 vs #9, etc. (power-of-2 bracket)
  - Assigns bye matches for odd participants
  - Creates TournamentMatch records for first round
  - Creates placeholder matches for future rounds
 
--> Bye matches are not with "odd" numbers. With 350 robots in the system, you will want to get to 256 in the first round of single elimination, so many robots will get a bye (by highest current ELO, not by league!)
--> So the entire bracket is known at the beginning of the tournament? Is there a way to easily display this? That would be a nice feature!

#### User Story 2.3: Round Execution
- **As a system**, I execute tournament rounds via battle orchestrator
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Creates ScheduledMatch records for current round
  - ScheduledMatches marked with battleType: "tournament"
  - Links ScheduledMatch to TournamentMatch
  - Battle execution uses same combat simulator as league battles
  - Battle records link back to TournamentMatch
  - Winners advance to next round automatically
 
--> I agree this should use the same combat simulator. We need to account for rewards though, which will be different based on the tournament itself, and the progression in the tournament. This is true for credits, prestige and fame. 

#### User Story 2.4: Tournament Progression
- **As a system**, I progress tournaments through rounds automatically
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - After round completes, winners populate next round matches
  - Current round increments
  - Final round (1 match remaining) determines tournament winner
  - Winner recorded in Tournament.winnerId
  - Tournament status changes to "completed"
  - User's championshipTitles increments for winner
 
--> How are we going to display this? 

#### User Story 2.5: Continuous Tournaments
- **As a system**, I start a new tournament when one completes
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - On tournament completion, check if new tournament should start
  - Auto-create new tournament if sufficient battle-ready robots exist
  - New tournament excludes recent tournament participants (cooldown: 1 cycle)
  - Seamless transition - no manual intervention needed
  - Configurable via admin settings (auto-start on/off)
 
--> Would a cooldown of 1 cycle not exclude the winner? For this first tournament, all robots should participate. We need to think about what to do when they're not battle read (yet), since their first scheduled match might be in 2 days because of a bye in the first round.

### Epic 3: Battle Integration

**As a player**, I want tournament battles to integrate seamlessly with the existing battle system.

#### User Story 3.1: Tournament Battle Type
- **As a system**, I categorize tournament battles separately from league battles
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Battle.battleType supports "tournament" (existing: "league")
  - Tournament battles use same combat simulator
  - Tournament battles generate same detailed battle logs
  - Battle reports display tournament context
  - ELO changes apply same as league battles
 
--> I agree this should use the same combat simulator. We need to account for rewards though, which will be different based on the tournament itself, and the progression in the tournament. This is true for credits, prestige and fame. 
--> ELO changes are fine, since league promotion is also dependant on League Points.

#### User Story 3.2: Multiple Upcoming Matches
- **As a player**, I can see all my upcoming matches (league + tournament)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - ScheduledMatch queries return both league and tournament matches
  - UI displays match type clearly (league vs tournament)
  - Robots can have multiple upcoming matches simultaneously 
  - No scheduling conflicts (can't schedule tournament match if league match exists for same time)
  - Battle readiness warnings account for both match types
 
--> A robot is either ready for a match or is not. 

#### User Story 3.3: Battle Reports
- **As a player**, I can view tournament battle results in my battle history
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Battle history includes tournament battles
  - Tournament battles labeled clearly
  - Shows tournament name and round information
  - Links to tournament bracket view 
  - Same financial breakdown as league battles

### Epic 4: Financial Integration

**As a player**, I want to earn rewards for tournament participation and victories.

#### User Story 4.1: Tournament Rewards
- **As a player**, I earn enhanced rewards for tournament battles
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - **Participation Rewards**: Same as league battles (30% of league base)
  - **Win Rewards**: 1.5× league battle rewards (tournament bonus)
  - **Prestige**: 2× prestige for tournament wins vs league wins
  - **Fame**: 1.5× fame for tournament wins vs league wins
  - **Championship Title**: +1 championshipTitles for tournament winner
  - **Streaming Income**: Tournament battles count toward streaming multiplier
 
--> Rewards should not be based on the league since all robots from all leagues enter. Rewards should be based on round. The further a robot advances, the better the rewards. The bigger the tournament, the better the rewards. Maybe the first tournament starts with 15 robots and the second with 198. Better rewards. 
--> There should be a reward formula applied taking into account the total robots that entered the tournament and the number of robots still active in the tournament. This should count for credits, prestige and fame. 
--> No rewards for byes in tournaments. There is no match. There is no streaming income. 

#### User Story 4.2: Reward Calculation
- **As a system**, I calculate tournament rewards using existing economy functions
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Uses getLeagueBaseReward() for robot's current league
  - Applies tournament multiplier (1.5×) to win rewards
  - Applies prestige multiplier from user's prestige level
  - Awards participation reward to loser
  - Bye matches award reduced participation reward (50%)
  - All rewards deposited immediately after battle
 
--> No, not based on league. Based on number of participants. Find a meaningful formula, even if there are 100k robots participating in the first round. 

#### User Story 4.3: Financial Tracking
- **As a player**, I can track my tournament earnings separately
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Battle records include tournament rewards breakdown
  - User stats track total tournament earnings 
  - Financial reports distinguish league vs tournament income 

### Epic 5: Admin Integration

**As an admin**, I can control tournament execution and integrate with daily cycle.

#### User Story 5.1: Manual Tournament Trigger
- **As an admin**, I can manually start a tournament
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - POST /api/admin/tournaments/create endpoint
  - Creates tournament with all eligible robots
  - Returns tournament details (id, participants, bracket)
  - Error handling for insufficient participants
 
--> I want to trigger a tournament cycle each day. If there is none active currently, start one. If there is an active one, run matches and prepare for next round of tournament. 
--> I also want to see the tournament progress somewhere. 

#### User Story 5.2: Tournament Round Execution
- **As an admin**, I can manually execute tournament rounds
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - POST /api/admin/tournaments/:id/execute-round endpoint
  - Executes current round battles
  - Advances to next round if all battles complete
  - Completes tournament if final round finishes
  - Returns round execution summary

#### User Story 5.3: Daily Cycle Integration
- **As an admin**, tournaments execute as part of daily cycle
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - /api/admin/cycles/bulk includes tournament execution
  - Step added: "Execute tournament rounds" (after league battles)
  - Auto-creates new tournament if none active and robots available
  - Configurable option: includeTournaments (default: true)
  - Tournament execution summary in cycle results

#### User Story 5.4: Tournament Status Endpoint
- **As an admin**, I can view active tournament status
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - GET /api/admin/tournaments endpoint lists all tournaments
  - GET /api/admin/tournaments/:id endpoint shows tournament details
  - Includes: current round, participants, bracket, winners
  - Shows pending matches in current round

### Tournament Reward Formulas

#### Win Rewards (Tournament Multiplier)

```typescript
// Base formula (same as league)
const leagueReward = getLeagueBaseReward(robot.currentLeague).midpoint;
const prestigeMultiplier = getPrestigeMultiplier(user.prestige);
const baseReward = leagueReward * prestigeMultiplier;

// Tournament bonus
const TOURNAMENT_WIN_MULTIPLIER = 1.5;
const tournamentReward = baseReward * TOURNAMENT_WIN_MULTIPLIER;
```

#### Prestige Awards (Tournament Multiplier)

```typescript
// Base prestige by league (same as league battles)
const leaguePrestige = {
  bronze: 5,
  silver: 10,
  gold: 20,
  platinum: 30,
  diamond: 50,
  champion: 75,
}[robot.currentLeague];

// Tournament multiplier
const TOURNAMENT_PRESTIGE_MULTIPLIER = 2.0;
const tournamentPrestige = leaguePrestige * TOURNAMENT_PRESTIGE_MULTIPLIER;

// Championship title bonus (final round only)
if (isFinalRound && isWinner) {
  user.championshipTitles += 1;
  const CHAMPIONSHIP_PRESTIGE_BONUS = 500;
  tournamentPrestige += CHAMPIONSHIP_PRESTIGE_BONUS;
}
```

#### Fame Awards (Tournament Multiplier)

```typescript
// Base fame by league (same as league battles)
const leagueFame = {
  bronze: 2,
  silver: 5,
  gold: 10,
  platinum: 15,
  diamond: 25,
  champion: 40,
}[robot.currentLeague];

// Performance multipliers (same as league)
if (finalHP === maxHP) {
  leagueFame *= 2.0; // Perfect victory
} else if (finalHP / maxHP > 0.8) {
  leagueFame *= 1.5; // Dominating victory
} else if (finalHP / maxHP < 0.2) {
  leagueFame *= 1.25; // Comeback victory
}

// Tournament multiplier
const TOURNAMENT_FAME_MULTIPLIER = 1.5;
const tournamentFame = leagueFame * TOURNAMENT_FAME_MULTIPLIER;
```

#### Round-Based Bonuses (Progressive Rewards)

```typescript
// Later rounds = higher rewards
const roundMultipliers = {
  1: 1.0,    // First round (many participants)
  2: 1.2,    // Round of 16/32
  3: 1.4,    // Quarter-finals
  4: 1.6,    // Semi-finals
  5: 2.0,    // Finals
};

const roundBonus = roundMultipliers[round] || 1.0;
finalReward *= roundBonus;
```

## Business Logic & Rules

### Tournament Eligibility

**Robots eligible for tournament:**
- ✅ HP ≥ 75% (battle-ready threshold)
- ✅ All required weapons equipped (based on loadoutType)
- ✅ Not already participating in an active tournament
- ✅ Not the bye-robot (system robot)
- ⚠️ **Conflict Avoidance**: Can participate even if scheduled for league match (tournaments and leagues run independently)

--> Treat this as if matches are run sequentially. Tournament first makes most sense. Auto-repair, Run tournament, auto repair, run leagues, rebalance leagues, run finances makes a nice daily cycle.  

**Tournament creation requirements:**
- Minimum participants: 4 robots
- Maximum participants: Unlimited (bracket size determined by participants)
- Auto-start: Only if ≥8 eligible robots available (ensures competitive field)

### Bracket Generation Algorithm

**Single Elimination Seeding:**

1. **Get Eligible Robots**: Query all battle-ready robots not in active tournaments
2. **Sort by ELO**: Highest to lowest (skill-based seeding)
3. **Calculate Rounds**: `maxRounds = Math.ceil(Math.log2(participants))`
4. **Handle Byes**: If participants not power of 2, highest seeds get byes
   - Example: 13 participants → 16-slot bracket → 3 byes (#1, #2, #3 seeds)
5. **Generate Pairings**: Traditional bracket structure
   - Round 1: #1 vs #16, #8 vs #9, #4 vs #13, #5 vs #12, etc.
6. **Create Placeholder Matches**: Future rounds have null robot IDs until winners determined

--> See earlier comments about battle-readiness. Do we need a solution here? What happens is a robot is battle ready at the start of the tournament but is not ready for his battle in round 3?

**Example Bracket (8 participants):**
```
Round 1 (4 matches):
  Match 1: Seed #1 vs Seed #8
  Match 2: Seed #4 vs Seed #5
  Match 3: Seed #2 vs Seed #7
  Match 4: Seed #3 vs Seed #6

Round 2 (2 matches):
  Match 5: Winner Match 1 vs Winner Match 2
  Match 6: Winner Match 3 vs Winner Match 4

Round 3 (1 match):
  Match 7: Winner Match 5 vs Winner Match 6 (FINALS)
```

### Tournament Progression Flow

```
1. Tournament Created → status: "pending"
   - Generate bracket
   - Create TournamentMatch records for all rounds
   - First round has robot IDs, later rounds have placeholders

2. Start Tournament → status: "active", currentRound: 1
   - Create ScheduledMatch records for Round 1
   - Link ScheduledMatch → TournamentMatch

3. Execute Round 1 Battles
   - Battle orchestrator processes scheduled matches
   - Battle records created with battleType: "tournament"
   - Winners recorded in TournamentMatch.winnerId

4. Advance to Round 2 → currentRound: 2
   - Populate Round 2 TournamentMatches with Round 1 winners
   - Create ScheduledMatch records for Round 2
   - Repeat until...

5. Final Round Completes → status: "completed"
   - Last match determines tournament winner
   - Tournament.winnerId = final match winner
   - User.championshipTitles += 1 for winner
   - completedAt timestamp set

6. Auto-Create Next Tournament
   - Check if sufficient eligible robots (≥8)
   - Create new tournament automatically
   - Exclude recent tournament participants (cooldown: 1 day)
```

### Conflict Management

**League vs Tournament Scheduling:**
- Robots CAN have both league and tournament matches scheduled
- Maximum 2 upcoming matches per robot (1 league + 1 tournament)
- Scheduled times must differ by ≥1 hour (prevents simultaneous battles)
- Battle readiness warnings account for both match types

--> Robots might have multiple tournament matches on the same day in the future. 
--> We'll pick schedules that fit, but this is not in place for the prototype phase.

**Tournament vs Tournament:**
- Robots CANNOT participate in multiple active tournaments simultaneously
- Tournament creation excludes robots already in active tournaments
- Tournament completion allows robot to enter next tournament

--> CAN participate in multiple active tournaments. What we're implementing now is a "All Robots Single Elimination Tournament". In the future we'll have multiple tournaments running (Bronze League tournaments for example where only robots from Bronze league are particpating) at the same time as this mega all-robots tournament. 

### Bye Match Handling

**When Byes Occur:**
- Participant count not a power of 2 (e.g., 13 participants → 3 byes in Round 1)

**Bye Match Rules:**
- Highest seeds receive byes (reward better ELO)
- TournamentMatch created with: robot1Id = seeded robot, robot2Id = null, isByeMatch = true
- No Battle record created (robot advances automatically)
- Reduced participation reward: 50% of normal (no combat effort)
- Robot takes no damage (fully repaired state maintained)
- Advances to next round immediately

--> Bye = no match, no rewards, no battle record. Scheduled match in next round.
