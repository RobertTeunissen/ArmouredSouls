## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for overhauling the My Robots list page (`/robots`) to align with the comprehensive design system established for Armoured Souls. This page serves as the **robot roster overview** where players view and manage their collection of battle robots. It must communicate mastery, pride of ownership, and systematic management through the **Direction B (Precision)** logo state and management-appropriate visual design.


## Background & Context

### Current State

- ✅ Robots sorted by ELO (highest first) (v1.3)
- ✅ "Repair All Robots" button with total cost and discount indication
- ✅ Repair All button functional - actually repairs robots and deducts credits (v1.4)
- ✅ Repair All button calculates cost based on actual HP damage (HP < maxHP), works for any robot needing repair (v1.8)
- ✅ Backend repair-all endpoint calculates cost from HP damage, matching frontend logic - end-to-end repair works (v1.8.1)
- ✅ Design system color palette applied (primary #58a6ff, surface colors, status colors)
- ✅ Empty state provides clear call-to-action for first robot creation
- ✅ Quick access to Create Robot functionality (Weapon Shop removed from this page)
- ✅ Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2-3 columns desktop)
- ✅ All status information visible at a glance for fleet management
- ✅ Battle Readiness calculated from actual HP/Shield values, with reason displayed when not battle ready (v1.3)
- ✅ Complete battle readiness checks including weapon equipped status (v1.4)
- ✅ Robot capacity indicator showing current/max robots (X/Y format) (v1.4)
- ✅ Create Robot button disabled when at capacity with tooltip explanation (v1.4)
- ✅ Complete loadout validation based on loadout type (single, weapon_shield, dual_wield, two_handed) (v1.5)
- ✅ Specific reasons shown for incomplete loadouts (Missing Shield, Missing Offhand Weapon, etc.) (v1.5)
- ✅ Battle readiness based on HP and loadout only - shields excluded (regenerate automatically, no cost) (v1.6)
- ✅ Roster expansion capacity updates dynamically when returning from facility upgrades (v1.7)

**Impact**: Establishes the central hub for robot management, reinforcing player's role as stable manager with visual pride in their robot collection.

**What's Working Well**:

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Visual Enhancement**: Transform robot cards to display comprehensive status at a glance
2. **Design System Compliance**: Apply established color palette, typography, and component patterns
3. **Fleet Management**: Enable quick assessment of entire robot collection (HP, readiness, performance)
4. **Competitive Context**: Display ELO, League, and Win/Loss records prominently
5. **Ownership Pride**: Use larger portraits and polished styling to emphasize player investment
6. **Image System Preparation**: Reserve space for robot portraits (256×256px) for future image implementation

### Success Metrics

- **Information Density**: Display 8+ data points per robot card (name, ELO, league, HP, shield, weapon, wins/losses, readiness)
- **Visual Consistency**: 100% compliance with design system color tokens
- **Usability**: Players can identify damaged robots requiring repair in <3 seconds
- **Engagement**: Players can assess competitive standing of each robot without clicking through
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)

### Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- ❌ Actual robot portrait images (only reserved space with placeholder)
- ❌ Filter and sort controls (future enhancement)
- ❌ Inline editing of robot names (future enhancement)
- ❌ Bulk actions (repair all, configure all)
- ❌ Robot comparison tool (separate page)
- ❌ Frame type badges (future enhancement when multiple frames exist)
- ❌ Pagination (implement only if user has >20 robots)

- Response includes manualRepairDiscount and preDiscountCost fields
- Frontend shows confirmation dialog with discount breakdown before repair
- Frontend shows success message after repair
- Frontend refreshes robots list to show updated status
- Handle errors (insufficient credits uses discounted cost in error, etc.)
```

**US-13: Robot Capacity Indicator** (v1.4)
```
As a player
I want to see my current robot count versus maximum capacity
And have the Create Robot button disabled when at capacity
So that I understand my roster limits and know when to upgrade

Acceptance Criteria:
- Fetch Roster Expansion facility level
- Calculate max robots: level + 1 (level 0 = 1 robot, level 1 = 2 robots, etc.)
- Display "My Robots (X/Y)" in page header
  - Example: "My Robots (3/5)"
- Create Robot button disabled when robots.length >= maxRobots
- Disabled button shows grey background
- Disabled button has tooltip: "Robot limit reached (X). Upgrade Roster Expansion facility to create more robots."
- Enabled button has tooltip: "Create a new robot"
- Similar to weapon shop capacity indicator
```

**US-14: Complete Loadout Validation** (v1.5)
```
As a player
I want battle readiness to validate my complete loadout configuration
So that I don't send robots with incomplete loadouts into battle

Acceptance Criteria:
- Battle readiness checks loadout type AND validates required weapons
- Loadout validation rules:
  - single: mainWeaponId required
  - two_handed: mainWeaponId required
  - dual_wield: mainWeaponId AND offhandWeaponId required
  - weapon_shield: mainWeaponId AND offhandWeaponId (must be shield type) required
- Specific reasons shown for incomplete loadouts:
  - "No Main Weapon" - No weapon equipped at all
  - "Missing Offhand Weapon" - dual_wield without offhand
  - "Missing Shield" - weapon_shield without offhand
  - "Offhand Must Be Shield" - weapon_shield with non-shield offhand
  - "Invalid Loadout Type" - Unknown loadout type
- New robots without weapons show "Not Ready (No Main Weapon)"
- Partial configurations (e.g., weapon_shield with only weapon) show "Not Ready (Missing Shield)"
- Validation happens BEFORE HP/Shield checks
- Aligns with matchmaking eligibility rules in MATCHMAKING_DECISIONS.md
```

**US-15: Shield Regeneration Does Not Affect Battle Readiness** (v1.6)
```
As a player
I want shield capacity changes to not affect my robot's battle readiness
So that equipping shields with added capacity doesn't make my robots appear damaged

Acceptance Criteria:
- Battle readiness calculation based on HP and loadout only
- Shield percentage NOT included in readiness formula
- Rationale: Energy shields regenerate automatically between battles (no credit cost)
- Only HP requires credits to repair, so only HP should affect readiness
- Readiness thresholds based on HP only:
  - ≥80% HP: "Battle Ready" (green)
  - 50-79% HP: "Damaged (Low HP)" (yellow)  
  - <50% HP: "Critical (Low HP)" (red)
- "Low Shield" reason removed (shields regenerate, not a concern)
- "Low HP and Shield" reason removed (only HP matters)
- Shield bar still displays for information, but doesn't affect status
- When shield capacity increases (e.g., equip shield with +100 capacity):
  - Robot remains "Battle Ready" if HP > 80%
  - Robot does not show as "Damaged" due to low shield percentage
- Aligns with ROBOT_ATTRIBUTES.md:
  - "Energy shields DO regenerate during battle"
  - "Energy shields reset to max after battle ends"
  - "Robot HP does NOT regenerate... Damage persists until repaired with Credits"
```

**US-16: Roster Expansion Capacity Updates Dynamically** (v1.7)
```
As a player
I want the robot capacity display to update immediately when I return from upgrading Roster Expansion
So that I can see my new capacity and create additional robots

Acceptance Criteria:
- Capacity display format: "My Robots (X/Y)" where X = current, Y = max
- Max capacity formula: maxRobots = rosterLevel + 1
- When user navigates to /robots page, facilities are refetched
- When user upgrades Roster Expansion and returns to /robots:
  - Capacity display updates immediately (e.g., from "1/1" to "1/2")
  - Create Robot button becomes enabled if below capacity
  - No manual page refresh required
- Implementation uses React Router location dependency
- Additional window focus handler for safety
- Works for all roster levels (0, 1, 2, ... 10+)

Testing Scenarios:
- Level 0: Shows (X/1), create first robot
- Level 1: After upgrade, shows (X/2), can create second robot
- Level 2: After upgrade, shows (X/3), can create third robot
```

**US-17: Repair All Button Debug Logging** (v1.7)
```
As a developer
I want debug logging for repair cost calculations
So that I can diagnose why the Repair All button may appear inaccessible

Acceptance Criteria:
- Console logging when robots are fetched:
  - Total robot count
  - Each robot's currentHP, maxHP, and repairCost values
- Console logging when repair costs are calculated:
  - robotCount
  - robotsWithRepairCost (how many have repairCost > 0)
  - totalBaseCost
  - discount percentage
  - discountedCost
  - repairBayLevel
- Logging helps identify:
  - Whether robots have repairCost set correctly
  - Whether button logic is working correctly
  - Whether issue is data or logic
- Button behavior remains correct:
  - Disabled when no repairs needed (repairCost = 0 for all robots)
  - Enabled when repairs needed (repairCost > 0 for any robot)

Note: New robots have repairCost = 0 (expected). Button is correctly disabled until robots take damage and need repair.
```

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture

**File**: `/prototype/frontend/src/pages/RobotsPage.tsx`

**Imports**:
```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';
import Navigation from '../components/Navigation';
```

**New Components** (optional refactor):
- `RobotCard.tsx` - Individual robot card component
- `StatusBar.tsx` - Reusable HP/Shield bar component
- `EmptyState.tsx` - Empty state display component

### Data Structure

**Robot Interface** (extended from current):
```typescript
interface Robot {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  elo: number;
  currentLeague: string;      // NEW: League tier
  // HP/Shield
  currentHP: number;           // NEW
  maxHP: number;               // NEW
  currentShield: number;       // NEW
  maxShield: number;           // NEW
  battleReadiness: number;     // NEW: Percentage
  // Performance
  totalBattles: number;        // NEW
  wins: number;                // NEW
  losses: number;              // NEW
  // Weapon
  weaponInventoryId: number | null;
  weaponInventory: {
    weapon: {
      name: string;
      weaponType: string;
    };
  } | null;
  // Meta
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### API Requirements

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/robots`

**Current Response**: ✅ Returns robot array with basic data

**Required Additions** (backend):
- Include `currentHP`, `maxHP`, `currentShield`, `maxShield`
- Include `battleReadiness` (calculated)
- Include `totalBattles`, `wins`, `losses`
- Include `currentLeague`

**If backend doesn't have these fields yet**:
- Frontend can calculate: `battleReadiness = ((currentHP/maxHP + currentShield/maxShield) / 2) * 100`
- Frontend can derive: `winRate = (wins / totalBattles * 100).toFixed(1)`
- Use placeholder for missing data: League = "Unranked", Readiness = "N/A"

### Utility Functions

**Status Bar Color Logic**:
```typescript
const getHPColor = (currentHP: number, maxHP: number): string => {
  const percentage = (currentHP / maxHP) * 100;
  if (percentage >= 70) return 'bg-success';     // Green
  if (percentage >= 30) return 'bg-warning';     // Amber
  return 'bg-error';                             // Red
};
```

**Battle Readiness Calculation**:
```typescript
const calculateReadiness = (
  currentHP: number,
  maxHP: number,
  currentShield: number,
  maxShield: number
): number => {
  const hpPercent = (currentHP / maxHP) * 100;
  const shieldPercent = maxShield > 0 ? (currentShield / maxShield) * 100 : 100;
  return Math.round((hpPercent + shieldPercent) / 2);
};
```

**Readiness Status Text**:
```typescript
const getReadinessStatus = (readiness: number): { text: string; color: string } => {
  if (readiness >= 80) return { text: 'Battle Ready', color: 'text-success' };
  if (readiness >= 50) return { text: 'Damaged', color: 'text-warning' };
  return { text: 'Critical', color: 'text-error' };
};
```

**Win Rate Calculation**:
```typescript
const calculateWinRate = (wins: number, totalBattles: number): string => {
  if (totalBattles === 0) return '0.0';
  return ((wins / totalBattles) * 100).toFixed(1);
};
```

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies

**Completed Prerequisites**:
- ✅ Navigation with Direction B logo implemented
- ✅ Design system color palette in Tailwind config
- ✅ Backend API endpoint `/api/robots` functional

**Required Before Implementation**:
- ⚠️ Backend API must return: `currentHP`, `maxHP`, `currentShield`, `maxShield`, `wins`, `losses`, `totalBattles`, `currentLeague`
- ⚠️ If backend missing fields, frontend can use placeholders or calculate from available data

**Future Dependencies** (out of scope):
- 🔮 Robot portrait images (Phase 2: Image System)
- 🔮 Frame type badges (Phase 2: Multiple frame types)
- 🔮 Filter/sort controls (Phase 2: Enhanced UX)

### Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Backend API Missing Required Fields**
- **Impact**: HIGH - Core functionality depends on HP, wins/losses data
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Use mock data for development/testing
  - Add placeholder values if fields missing ("N/A", 0, etc.)
  - Backend can add fields incrementally
  - Frontend gracefully handles missing data

**Risk 2: Design System Color Tokens Not in Tailwind Config**
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Visual design won't match specifications
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Verify Tailwind config has all required colors
  - Add missing colors before implementation
  - Use design system quick reference for color values

**Risk 3: Performance with Many Robots**
- **Impact**: LOW - Users unlikely to have >50 robots in prototype phase
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Implement pagination if >20 robots
  - Use React virtualization if needed (future)
  - Optimize re-renders with React.memo

**Risk 4: Portrait Space Looks Empty Without Images**
- **Impact**: LOW - Placeholder acceptable for Phase 1
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Use robot name initial (first letter, large font)
  - OR use generic robot icon/silhouette
  - Design layout works with or without images
  - Future image integration is seamless

## Resolved Questions

All questions from the initial PRD have been resolved through implementation:

### Q1: Backend API Fields
**Question**: Does `/api/robots` currently return HP, Shield, and performance data?

**Resolution**: ✅ Yes, all required fields are returned by the API:
- `currentHP`, `maxHP`, `currentShield`, `maxShield`
- `wins`, `losses`, `draws`, `totalBattles`
- `currentLeague`, `leaguePoints`
- `battleReadiness`, `repairCost`
- `loadoutType`, `mainWeaponId`, `offhandWeaponId`

### Q2: Roster Capacity
**Question**: What is the maximum number of robots a player can own?

**Resolution**: ✅ Dynamic based on Roster Expansion facility:
- Formula: `maxRobots = rosterLevel + 1`
- Level 0 (default): 1 robot
- Level 1: 2 robots
- Level 2: 3 robots
- Etc.
- Fetched from `/api/facilities` endpoint

### Q3: League System
**Question**: Is the League field (`currentLeague`) already in the database?

**Resolution**: ✅ Yes, `currentLeague` field exists and is populated:
- League tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master
- Displayed with League Points (LP)
- Format: "Silver │ LP: 45"

### Q4: Battle Readiness Formula
**Question**: Is the proposed formula `((HP% + Shield%) / 2)` acceptable?

**Resolution**: ✅ Modified in v1.6 to HP-only:
- **Final Formula**: `readiness = HP%` (shields excluded)
- **Rationale**: Shields regenerate automatically between battles (no credit cost)
- Only HP requires credits to repair, so only HP affects readiness
- Aligns with game mechanics in ROBOT_ATTRIBUTES.md

### Q5: Empty Portrait Placeholder
**Question**: What should display in portrait space before images are implemented?

**Resolution**: ✅ Robot name initial:
- Shows first letter of robot name in large font
- Size: 128×128px (w-32 h-32) for better card proportions
- Background: #1a1f29 (surface)
- Border: #3d444d (neutral gray)
- Text: #58a6ff (primary), 72px font size

### Q6: Filter/Sort Controls
**Question**: Should these be implemented in Phase 1 or deferred?

**Resolution**: ✅ Deferred to future enhancement:
- Current implementation: ELO sorting only (highest first)
- Filter/sort UI controls: Future Phase 2 enhancement
- Sorting works automatically without user controls

---

### v1.3 Changes (February 2, 2026)

**Bug Fixes & Enhancements**:

1. **ELO Sorting**
   - Issue: Robots displayed in database order (not meaningful)
   - Fix: Sort by ELO descending after fetch
   - Code: Line 116 in RobotsPage.tsx
   - Impact: Strongest robots appear first

2. **Battle Readiness Calculation**
   - Issue: Used stored `battleReadiness` field from database (could be outdated)
   - Fix: Calculate dynamically from current HP and Shield values
   - Formula: `Math.round((hpPercent + shieldPercent) / 2)`
   - Code: Lines 45-49 in RobotsPage.tsx
   - Impact: Always shows current readiness status

3. **Reason Display**
   - Issue: Status text only ("Battle Ready", "Damaged", "Critical")
   - Fix: Show specific reason when not battle ready
   - Reasons:
     - "Low HP" - when HP < 80%
     - "Low Shield" - when Shield < 80%
     - "Low HP and Shield" - when both < 80%
   - Code: Lines 51-80 in RobotsPage.tsx
   - Display: "65% │ Damaged (Low HP)"
   - Impact: Players understand what needs repair

### v1.4 Changes (February 2, 2026)

**Feature Enhancements**:

1. **Complete Battle Readiness Checks**
   - Issue: Robots showed "Battle Ready" without weapons equipped
   - Fix: Added weapon check to `getReadinessStatus()`
   - Logic: Check `weaponInventoryId !== null` before HP/Shield checks
   - Display: "Not Ready (No Weapon Equipped)" - red color
   - Code: Lines 51-86 in RobotsPage.tsx
   - Impact: Prevents sending unarmed robots to battle

2. **Functional Repair All Button**
   - Issue: Button showed placeholder alert, no actual functionality
   - Backend: Added POST `/api/robots/repair-all` endpoint
   - Features:
     - Calculates total cost with Repair Bay discount
     - Checks sufficient credits
     - Updates all damaged robots in transaction
     - Deducts credits from user
   - Frontend: Calls endpoint, shows confirmation, handles errors
   - Code: 
     - Backend: robots.ts lines 1214-1308
     - Frontend: RobotsPage.tsx lines 154-193
   - Impact: Fully functional repair system

3. **Robot Capacity Indicator**
   - Issue: No indication of robot capacity, Create button always enabled
   - Fix: 
     - Fetch Roster Expansion facility level
     - Calculate `maxRobots = level + 1`
     - Display "My Robots (X/Y)" in header
     - Disable Create button when at capacity
   - Code: RobotsPage.tsx lines 93, 139-144, 191-192, 199
   - Impact: Clear capacity management similar to weapon shop

### v1.5 Changes (February 2, 2026)

**Critical Fix: Complete Loadout Validation**:

1. **Loadout Type Validation**
   - Issue: Battle readiness only checked `weaponInventoryId !== null`
   - Problem: Newly created robots showed "Battle Ready", partial loadouts not caught
   - Examples:
     - Robot with no weapons: Showed as ready ❌
     - weapon_shield with only weapon: Showed as ready ❌
   - Fix: Implemented `isLoadoutComplete()` function
   - Code: RobotsPage.tsx lines 51-100
   - Impact: Prevents incomplete loadouts from appearing battle ready

2. **Loadout Type Rules Implemented**
   - **single**: mainWeaponId required only
   - **two_handed**: mainWeaponId required only
   - **dual_wield**: mainWeaponId AND offhandWeaponId required
   - **weapon_shield**: mainWeaponId AND offhandWeaponId (must be shield) required
   - Validates weapon type for weapon_shield (offhand must be "shield")
   - Returns specific reason for each incomplete case

3. **Specific Reason Messages**
   - "No Main Weapon" - No weapon equipped at all
   - "Missing Offhand Weapon" - dual_wield without offhand
   - "Missing Shield" - weapon_shield without offhand
   - "Offhand Must Be Shield" - weapon_shield with non-shield offhand
   - "Invalid Loadout Type" - Unknown loadout type
   - Display: "Not Ready (Missing Shield)" - red color
   - Code: RobotsPage.tsx lines 51-100, 347-356

4. **Updated Robot Interface**
   - Added `loadoutType: string` field
   - Added `mainWeaponId` and `offhandWeaponId` fields
   - Updated to use `mainWeapon` and `offhandWeapon` relations
   - Removed old `weaponInventoryId` field
   - Code: RobotsPage.tsx lines 6-37

5. **Alignment with Matchmaking**
   - Follows same validation logic as MATCHMAKING_DECISIONS.md
   - Ensures UI matches what matchmaking scheduler enforces
   - Prevents frustration of robots not being scheduled

### v1.6 Changes (February 2, 2026)

**Critical Fix: Shield Regeneration Does Not Affect Battle Readiness**:

1. **Problem Identified**
   - Issue: When shield capacity increases (e.g., equipping shield with +100 maxShield), robots showed as "Damaged" or "Not Ready"
   - Root cause: Battle readiness formula included shield percentage
   - Example: Shield adds +100 capacity → currentShield=200, maxShield=300 → 67% → "Damaged (Low Shield)" ❌
   - Impact: Misleading status since shields regenerate automatically between battles (no credit cost)

2. **Shield Regeneration Rules** (from ROBOT_ATTRIBUTES.md)
   - Energy shields regenerate during battle (based on Power Core attribute)
   - Energy shields reset to max after battle ends
   - Shields never require credits to restore
   - Only HP requires credits to repair

3. **Battle Readiness Formula Change**
   - **Before**: `readiness = (HP% + Shield%) / 2`
     - Problem: Penalized robots for low shields (which regenerate free)
     - Misleading: Robot with 80% HP + 25% Shield = 52.5% readiness = "Damaged"
   - **After**: `readiness = HP%` only
     - Correct: Only penalizes for HP damage (which costs credits to repair)
     - Accurate: Robot with 80% HP (any shield) = 80% readiness = "Battle Ready"

4. **Removed Misleading Reasons**
   - ❌ Removed: "Low Shield" (shields regenerate, not a concern)
   - ❌ Removed: "Low HP and Shield" (only HP matters for readiness)
   - ✅ Kept: "Low HP" (accurate reason - requires credits to fix)

5. **Code Changes**
   - Updated `calculateReadiness()`: Removed shield parameters and calculation
   - Simplified `getReadinessStatus()`: Removed shield parameters and shield checks
   - Updated function calls: Removed shield arguments
   - Code: RobotsPage.tsx lines 53-58, 105-138, 342-353

6. **Readiness Thresholds** (HP-based only)
   - ≥80% HP: "Battle Ready" (green)
   - 50-79% HP: "Damaged (Low HP)" (yellow)
   - <50% HP: "Critical (Low HP)" (red)
   - Loadout check remains first priority

7. **Shield Bar Display**
   - Shield bar still shows current/max visually (for information)
   - Players can see shield status
   - But shield percentage does NOT affect battle readiness status
   - Shields are informational only

8. **Impact**
   - ✅ Equipping shields with added capacity no longer makes robots appear damaged
   - ✅ Battle readiness now accurately reflects what requires player action
   - ✅ HP requires credits → affects readiness
   - ✅ Shields regenerate free → don't affect readiness
   - ✅ Aligns with game mechanics (ROBOT_ATTRIBUTES.md)

### v1.7 Changes (February 2, 2026)

**ACTUAL BUG FIX: API Endpoint Corrected**:

1. **Problem: Roster Expansion Capacity Always Showed x/1**
   - Issue: Regardless of facility level, always displayed "(X/1)"
   - Example: Upgrade to Level 1, 2, 5, 10 → still showed "(X/1)"
   - User report: "Roster Expansion upgrades now have no effect on the page"
   - Impact: Create Robot button stayed disabled even after upgrades

2. **Root Cause: API Endpoint Mismatch**
   - Frontend called: `http://localhost:3001/api/facility` (singular) ❌
   - Backend serves: `/api/facilities` (plural) ✅
   - Result: 404 error, facilities never fetched, rosterLevel always 0
   - Line: RobotsPage.tsx line 215

3. **Solution: Corrected API Endpoint**
   ```typescript
   // Before (WRONG):
   const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/facility', {
   
   // After (CORRECT):
   const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/facilities', {
   ```
   - One character fix: Added 's' to make it plural
   - Now matches backend route: `app.use('/api/facilities', facilityRoutes)`

4. **Expected Behavior After Fix**
   - Level 0: Shows "(X/1)" - 1 robot max ✅
   - Level 1: Shows "(X/2)" - 2 robots max ✅
   - Level 2: Shows "(X/3)" - 3 robots max ✅
   - Level 10: Shows "(X/11)" - 11 robots max ✅
   - Create button enabled when below capacity ✅
   - Capacity updates immediately when navigating back from facility upgrades ✅

5. **Repair All Button Status**
   - Backend endpoint: ✅ Exists at `/api/robots/repair-all`
   - Button logic: ✅ Correct (disabled when no repairs needed)
   - Expected behavior: Button only enabled when robots have damage (repairCost > 0)
   - User report: "Not accessible even with 1 robot"
   - Likely scenario: User tested with newly created robot (repairCost = 0)
   - This is CORRECT behavior - new robots don't need repairs

6. **Code Changes**
   - File: `/prototype/frontend/src/pages/RobotsPage.tsx`
   - Line 215: Changed `/api/facility` to `/api/facilities`
   - That's it! Simple one-character typo fix

7. **Testing Required**
   - Start backend and frontend servers
   - Login and check initial capacity (should show correct level)
   - Upgrade Roster Expansion facility
   - Navigate back to /robots → Capacity should increase
   - For repair button: Damage a robot through battle, then test button

## v1.8 Changes (February 2, 2026)

### Problem #2: Repair All Button Not Working with HP Damage

**User Report**: "I have a robot who fought a battle and is on 44% HP. This means he is NOT ready (= correct) but I cannot repair him. Even with 1 HP I might want to repair him and the button should be available. Anything below full HP should be considered."

1. **Root Cause: Button Only Checked repairCost Field**
   - Frontend calculated: `totalBaseCost = robots.reduce((sum, robot) => sum + (robot.repairCost || 0), 0);`
   - Button enabled when: `needsRepair = discountedCost > 0`
   - Issue: `robot.repairCost` field may not be set when robot takes damage
   - Result: Robot with 44% HP but repairCost = 0 → Button disabled ❌

2. **Solution: Calculate Cost Based on Actual HP Damage**
   ```typescript
   // New logic in calculateTotalRepairCost():
   const REPAIR_COST_PER_HP = 50; // Matches backend
   
   const totalBaseCost = robots.reduce((sum, robot) => {
     // If repairCost is set by backend, use it
     if (robot.repairCost && robot.repairCost > 0) {
       return sum + robot.repairCost;
     }
     
     // Otherwise, calculate based on HP damage
     const hpDamage = robot.maxHP - robot.currentHP;
     if (hpDamage > 0) {
       return sum + (hpDamage * REPAIR_COST_PER_HP);
     }
     
     return sum;
   }, 0);
   ```

3. **Repair Cost Formula** (Matches backend admin route):
   - Cost per HP: 50 credits
   - Formula: `repairCost = (maxHP - currentHP) * 50`
   - Example: Robot with 440/1000 HP → 560 damage × 50 = ₡28,000

4. **Expected Behavior After Fix**

   **Scenario 1: Robot with 44% HP (560 damage)**
   - Before: repairCost = 0 → Button disabled ❌
   - After: Calculated cost = 560 × 50 = ₡28,000 → Button enabled ✅
   
   **Scenario 2: Robot with 1 HP (999 damage)**
   - Before: repairCost = 0 → Button disabled ❌
   - After: Calculated cost = 999 × 50 = ₡49,950 → Button enabled ✅
   
   **Scenario 3: Robot with 100% HP (0 damage)**
   - Before: Button disabled ✅
   - After: Calculated cost = 0 → Button disabled ✅ (no change)
   
   **Scenario 4: Multiple robots with mixed states**
   - Robot A: 500/1000 HP → ₡25,000
   - Robot B: 1000/1000 HP → ₡0
   - Robot C: 800/1000 HP → ₡10,000
   - Total: ₡35,000 (before discount)
   - Button: ENABLED showing total cost ✅

5. **Repair Bay Discount Still Applied**
   - Formula: 5% per Repair Bay level
   - Example with Level 5 Repair Bay:
     - Base cost: ₡28,000
     - Discount: 25%
     - Final cost: ₡21,000
     - Display: "🔧 Repair All: ₡21,000 (25% off)"

6. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
   ```javascript
   console.log('Repair cost calculation:', {
     robotCount: 1,
     robotsNeedingRepair: 1,       // Total needing repair
     robotsWithRepairCost: 0,       // From backend field
     robotsWithHPDamage: 1,         // Calculated from HP
     totalBaseCost: 28000,
     discount: 0,
     discountedCost: 28000,
     repairBayLevel: 0
   });
   ```

7. **Code Changes**
   - File: `/prototype/frontend/src/pages/RobotsPage.tsx`
   - Lines 237-279: Completely rewrote `calculateTotalRepairCost()` function
   - Added REPAIR_COST_PER_HP constant (50 credits per HP)
   - Added HP-based cost calculation fallback
   - Enhanced debug logging

8. **User Requirement Met**
   - ✅ "Anything below full HP should be considered" - Now detects ANY HP damage
   - ✅ "Even with 1 HP I might want to repair him" - Works at any HP level
   - ✅ "The button should be available" - Button enabled when HP < maxHP

## v1.8.1 Changes (February 2, 2026)

### User Report

"It shows! And even the discount shows! However, when I click the button and then confirm, I see: Repair failed: No robots need repair"

### Root Cause

**Frontend/Backend Mismatch**: The v1.8 fix only updated the frontend to calculate repair costs from HP damage. The backend still used the old logic that only checked the `repairCost` field.

**Frontend Logic (v1.8)** ✅:
```typescript
// Checks HP damage
if (robot.currentHP < robot.maxHP) {
  const hpDamage = robot.maxHP - robot.currentHP;
  cost = hpDamage * 50;
}
```

**Backend Logic (old)** ❌:
```typescript
// Only checked repairCost field
const robots = await prisma.robot.findMany({
  where: { userId, repairCost: { gt: 0 } }
});
// Returns empty if repairCost = 0, even with HP damage
```

**Result**: Frontend showed button with cost, backend rejected repair with "No robots need repair"

### Solution

**Updated Backend** (`/prototype/backend/src/routes/robots.ts` lines 1241-1286):

1. **Get All Robots** (not just those with repairCost > 0):
```typescript
const allRobots = await prisma.robot.findMany({
  where: { userId }
});
```

2. **Calculate Cost with Same Logic as Frontend**:
```typescript
const REPAIR_COST_PER_HP = 50; // Matches frontend

const robotsNeedingRepair = allRobots
  .map(robot => {
    let repairCost = 0;
    
    // Use backend repairCost if set
    if (robot.repairCost > 0) {
      repairCost = robot.repairCost;
    } 
    // Otherwise calculate from HP damage (MATCHES FRONTEND)
    else if (robot.currentHP < robot.maxHP) {
      const hpDamage = robot.maxHP - robot.currentHP;
      repairCost = hpDamage * REPAIR_COST_PER_HP;
    }
    
    return { ...robot, calculatedRepairCost: repairCost };
  })
  .filter(robot => robot.calculatedRepairCost > 0);
```

3. **Process Repairs**:
```typescript
const totalBaseCost = robotsNeedingRepair.reduce(
  (sum, robot) => sum + robot.calculatedRepairCost, 0
);
const finalCost = Math.floor(totalBaseCost * (1 - discount / 100));
```

### End-to-End Flow (After v1.8.1)

```
1. Robot takes damage in battle
   HP: 440/1000 (560 damage)

2. Frontend calculates
   Cost: 560 × 50 = ₡28,000
   Button: ENABLED with "🔧 Repair All: ₡28,000"

3. User clicks button
   Dialog: "Repair all robots for ₡28,000?"
   User confirms

4. Backend calculates (NOW MATCHES FRONTEND)
   Cost: 560 × 50 = ₡28,000
   Validates: User has enough credits
   
5. Transaction executes
   - Deducts ₡28,000 from user
   - Updates robot: currentHP = maxHP (1000)
   - Clears repairCost = 0
   
6. Success response
   "Successfully repaired 1 robot(s) for ₡28,000"
   
7. Frontend updates
   - Robot HP shows 100%
   - Repair button becomes disabled
   - Credits balance updated
```

### Files Changed

**Backend**: `/prototype/backend/src/routes/robots.ts`
- Lines 1241-1286: Rewrote repair-all endpoint logic
- ~29 lines modified

**Logic Now Consistent**:
- Frontend: Checks `currentHP < maxHP` ✅
- Backend: Checks `currentHP < maxHP` ✅
- Both: Calculate `hpDamage × 50` ✅
- Both: Apply Repair Bay discount ✅

### Success Criteria

- [x] Backend calculates cost from HP damage (not just repairCost field)
- [x] Backend matches frontend calculation exactly
- [x] Repair succeeds when robot has HP < maxHP
- [x] Error "No robots need repair" only appears when truly no damage
- [x] Credits deducted correctly
- [x] Robot HP restored to 100%
- [x] Repair Bay discount applied correctly
