# Product Requirements Document: Robot Detail Page (`/robots/:id`)

**Project**: Armoured Souls  
**Document Type**: Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
**Version**: v1.1  
**Date**: February 10, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented 
**Page**: `/robots/:id` (Detail view for individual robot)

> **Note**: This PRD covers the individual robot DETAIL page. For the robots list page (`/robots`), see [PRD_ROBOTS_LIST_PAGE.md](PRD_ROBOTS_LIST_PAGE.md).

---

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for overhauling the Robots page GUI and implementing decimal-precision attribute values. Following the implementation of Battle Stances and Yield Threshold systems, the robot detail page requires a significant redesign to better organize the two primary functions: **Battle Configuration** and **Upgrade Robot**. Additionally, a new **Performance & Statistics** section will provide public-facing robot information accessible to all users.

The database schema will be updated to support decimal values (2 decimal places) for all 23 robot attributes, enabling more nuanced stat calculations where small bonuses from weapons and loadouts provide meaningful strategic value even at lower attribute levels.

**Success Criteria**: 
- Players can easily distinguish between Battle Configuration and Upgrade Robot sections
- Effective stats are presented in a comprehensive table format showing all modifier sources
- Page length is reduced by 30-40% through more efficient layouts
- Decimal attribute values enable strategic weapon choices at all levels
- Future image system integration is accommodated through reserved UI space

---

## Background & Context

### Current State

**What Exists:**
- ✅ Working Battle Configuration system (stance selector, yield threshold, weapon loadout)
- ✅ Working Upgrade Robot system (23 attributes with academy caps)
- ✅ Effective stats calculation including weapons, loadout, and stance modifiers
- ✅ StatComparison component showing modified attributes
- ✅ Complete backend calculations in robotCalculations.ts

**Current Issues:**
- ❌ Page is too long, requires excessive scrolling
- ❌ No clear visual separation between Battle Configuration and Upgrade functions
- ❌ Duplicate information (e.g., credit balance shown twice, upgrade costs repeated)
- ❌ Effective stats section is basic list format, not comprehensive table
- ❌ No performance/statistics section for public viewing
- ❌ Integer-only attributes limit strategic depth (5% bonus on 10 base = 0 effective)
- ❌ No reserved space for upcoming image system

**What's Working Well:**
- ✅ Battle stance blocks are visually clear and functional
- ✅ Weapon slot management is intuitive
- ✅ Upgrade buttons with cost display are straightforward

- **[PRD_IMAGE_SYSTEM.md (future branch)](https://github.com/RobertTeunissen/ArmouredSouls/blob/copilot/implement-images-in-gui/docs/PRD_IMAGE_SYSTEM.md)**: Upcoming image system requirements

### Why This Matters

**GUI Overhaul Benefits:**
- Better information architecture improves decision-making
- Reduced page length decreases cognitive load
- Clear functional separation helps players focus on their current task
- Comprehensive stat table enables strategic planning
- Public stats foster competitive analysis and community engagement

**Decimal Attributes Benefits:**
- 5% weapon bonus on 10 base attribute now yields 10.50 instead of 10
- More granular progression creates meaningful choices at all levels
- Strategic depth: Players can optimize fractional gains
- Better balance: Weapons remain valuable throughout progression

---

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Redesign Page Structure**: Clear visual distinction between Battle Configuration and Upgrade Robot sections
2. **Implement Comprehensive Stat Table**: Show base attributes, weapon effects, loadout effects, stance effects, and total in table format
3. **Add Performance/Statistics Section**: Public-facing robot information accessible to all users
4. **Reduce Page Length**: Consolidate duplicate information, use more efficient layouts
5. **Enable Decimal Attributes**: Update database and calculations to support 2-decimal precision
6. **Prepare for Images**: Reserve UI space for robot images, frame previews, and weapon icons

### Success Metrics

- Page scroll length reduced by 30-40%
- Players can identify Battle Configuration vs Upgrade sections without labels (visual clarity test)
- Effective stats table displays all 23 attributes with 4+ columns of modifier information
- Decimal calculations work correctly: 10 base + 5% bonus = 10.50 displayed
- No performance degradation with decimal math
- 90%+ of users understand stat table on first viewing (user testing)

### Non-Goals (Out of Scope for This PRD)

- ❌ Implementation of actual image system (only UI space reservation)
- ❌ Performance analytics dashboard (future enhancement)
- ❌ Comparison tool for multiple robots (future feature)
- ❌ Historical battle performance graphs (future feature)
- ❌ Attribute respec/reset functionality (separate epic)
- ❌ Mobile-specific layouts (desktop first, mobile in Phase 4)

### FR-5: Database Schema Changes for Decimal Attributes

**Prisma Schema Updates:**

All 23 robot attributes must be changed from `Int` to `Decimal`:

```prisma
model Robot {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // ===== 23 CORE ATTRIBUTES (Range: 1.00-50.00, precision 2 decimals) =====
  
  // Combat Systems (6 attributes)
  combatPower         Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("combat_power") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  targetingSystems    Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("targeting_systems") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  criticalSystems     Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("critical_systems") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  penetration         Decimal  @default(1.00) @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  weaponControl       Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("weapon_control") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  attackSpeed         Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("attack_speed") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  
  // Defensive Systems (5 attributes)
  armorPlating        Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("armor_plating") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  shieldCapacity      Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("shield_capacity") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  evasionThrusters    Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("evasion_thrusters") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  damageDampeners     Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("damage_dampeners") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  counterProtocols    Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("counter_protocols") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  
  // Chassis & Mobility (5 attributes)
  hullIntegrity       Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("hull_integrity") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  servoMotors         Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("servo_motors") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  gyroStabilizers     Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("gyro_stabilizers") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  hydraulicSystems    Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("hydraulic_systems") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  powerCore           Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("power_core") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  
  // AI Processing (4 attributes)
  combatAlgorithms    Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("combat_algorithms") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  threatAnalysis      Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("threat_analysis") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  adaptiveAI          Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("adaptive_ai") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  logicCores          Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("logic_cores") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  
  // Team Coordination (3 attributes)
  syncProtocols       Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("sync_protocols") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  supportSystems      Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("support_systems") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  formationTactics    Decimal  @default(1.00) @map("formation_tactics") @db.Decimal(5, 2)
  
  // ... rest of model ...
}
```

**Precision Specification:**
- `@db.Decimal(5, 2)`: Total 5 digits, 2 after decimal point
- Supports range: 0.00 to 999.99 (50.00 is max in practice)
- Examples: 1.00, 25.50, 49.99

**Migration Strategy:**
1. Create Prisma migration to alter column types
2. Existing integer values automatically converted to decimal (e.g., 25 → 25.00)
3. No data loss during migration
4. Backward compatible (can read old integer values as decimals)

### FR-6: Backend Calculation Updates

**robotCalculations.ts Updates:**

```typescript
// Update return type to handle Decimal
export function calculateEffectiveStats(robot: RobotWithWeapons): Record<string, number> {
  // ... existing logic ...
  
  // Convert Prisma Decimal to JavaScript number for calculations
  const baseValue = Number(robot[attr as keyof Robot]);
  
  // Apply formulas with decimal precision
  const effectiveValue = (baseValue + weaponBonus) * loadoutMultiplier * stanceMultiplier;
  
  // Round to 2 decimal places
  effectiveStats[attr] = Math.round(effectiveValue * 100) / 100;
  
  return effectiveStats;
}
```

**Key Changes:**
1. Convert Prisma `Decimal` objects to JavaScript `number` for math operations
2. Use `Math.round(value * 100) / 100` for 2-decimal precision
3. Ensure all formulas preserve decimal precision throughout calculation chain
4. Update type definitions to reflect `Decimal` in Prisma types

**Upgrade Cost Calculation (No Changes Needed):**
- Upgrade costs remain based on level (integer): `(currentLevel + 1) * 1000`
- When base attribute is 25.50, upgrade cost is still `Math.floor(26) * 1000 = ₡26,000`
- Level is determined by `Math.floor(attribute)` for upgrade purposes

### FR-7: Frontend Display Updates

**Decimal Formatting Utility:**

```typescript
// utils/formatters.ts
export function formatAttribute(value: number | string): string {
  const num = typeof value === 'string' ? parseFloat(value) : value;
  return num.toFixed(2);
}

export function formatAttributeShort(value: number | string): string {
  const num = typeof value === 'string' ? parseFloat(value) : value;
  // Show decimals only if non-zero
  return num % 1 === 0 ? num.toFixed(0) : num.toFixed(2);
}
```

**Component Updates:**
1. **RobotDetailPage.tsx**: Handle decimal values from API
2. **StatComparison.tsx**: Display decimal effective stats
3. **New Component: EffectiveStatsTable.tsx**: Comprehensive stat table
4. **New Component: PerformanceStats.tsx**: Statistics section
5. **Refactored Upgrade Section**: Compact attribute display

**Type Updates:**
```typescript
interface Robot {
  // ... existing fields ...
  combatPower: number; // Decimal from backend converted to number
  targetingSystems: number;
  // ... all 23 attributes as number type (converted from Decimal)
}
```

    <div className="text-sm text-gray-400">{weapon.weaponType}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Layout Considerations:**
- Fixed-width containers for image areas
- Layout doesn't break if images are empty/placeholder
- Alt text and aria-labels for accessibility
- Lazy loading preparation (when images added)

-- Combat Systems
ALTER TABLE robots ALTER COLUMN combat_power TYPE DECIMAL(5,2);
ALTER TABLE robots ALTER COLUMN targeting_systems TYPE DECIMAL(5,2);
ALTER TABLE robots ALTER COLUMN critical_systems TYPE DECIMAL(5,2);
ALTER TABLE robots ALTER COLUMN penetration TYPE DECIMAL(5,2);
ALTER TABLE robots ALTER COLUMN weapon_control TYPE DECIMAL(5,2);
ALTER TABLE robots ALTER COLUMN attack_speed TYPE DECIMAL(5,2);

-- Defensive Systems
ALTER TABLE robots ALTER COLUMN armor_plating TYPE DECIMAL(5,2);
ALTER TABLE robots ALTER COLUMN shield_capacity TYPE DECIMAL(5,2);
ALTER TABLE robots ALTER COLUMN evasion_thrusters TYPE DECIMAL(5,2);
ALTER TABLE robots ALTER COLUMN damage_dampeners TYPE DECIMAL(5,2);

-- No data loss occurs during this migration
```

### API Response Changes

**GET /api/robots/:id Response (Updated):**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Iron Fist",
  "elo": 1450,
  // Decimal values returned as strings to preserve precision
  "combatPower": "25.50",
  "targetingSystems": "18.00",
  "criticalSystems": "20.75",
  // ... all 23 attributes with decimal precision
  
  // Performance stats
  "totalBattles": 68,
  "wins": 45,
  "losses": 23,
  "damageDealtLifetime": 125430,
  "damageTakenLifetime": 89220,
  "kills": 38,
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Notes:**
- Decimal values serialized as strings in JSON to prevent precision loss
- Frontend converts to numbers using `parseFloat()` or `Number()`
- Battle calculations use native JavaScript number type (sufficient precision)

### Component Architecture

**New Components:**

1. **EffectiveStatsTable.tsx**
   - Props: `robot`, `showStanceModifiers`
   - Displays comprehensive stat table with all modifiers
   - Uses utility functions from `robotStats.ts`

2. **PerformanceStats.tsx**
   - Props: `robot`, `isOwner`
   - Displays read-only performance and statistics
   - Accessible to all users

3. **CompactAttributeRow.tsx**
   - Props: `attribute`, `robot`, `cap`, `onUpgrade`
   - Single-line attribute display with inline upgrade button
   - Replaces verbose current layout

**Modified Components:**

1. **RobotDetailPage.tsx**
   - Major layout restructure
   - Integration of new components
   - Remove credit balance card

2. **StatComparison.tsx**
   - Update to handle decimal values
   - Enhanced tooltip information

### Performance Considerations

**Decimal Math Performance:**
- JavaScript number type handles up to 15-17 significant digits
- 2-decimal precision well within JavaScript's capabilities
- No performance impact expected for typical operations
- Math operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` work identically with decimals

**Database Performance:**
- `DECIMAL(5,2)` storage: 5 bytes per value
- Previous `INTEGER` storage: 4 bytes per value
- Minimal storage overhead: +1 byte × 23 attributes = +23 bytes per robot
- Index performance unchanged
- Query performance unchanged

**Frontend Rendering:**
- Decimal formatting adds negligible overhead
- Table rendering: ~23 rows × 6 columns = 138 cells (trivial for modern browsers)
- No virtualization needed for single robot view

## User Experience

### Information Hierarchy

**Priority 1 (Top of Page):**
1. Robot identity (name, image, ELO, league)
2. Battle Configuration (most frequent action)

**Priority 2 (Middle of Page):**
3. Effective Stats Table (decision support)
4. Performance Statistics (analysis and tracking)

**Priority 3 (Bottom of Page):**
5. Upgrade Robot (less frequent, long-term planning)

### Interaction Patterns

**Battle Configuration:**
- Quick adjustments before battles
- Visual feedback on stat changes
- No page navigation required

**Effective Stats:**
- Passive information display
- No interactions (read-only)
- Sortable/filterable (future enhancement)

**Performance Statistics:**
- Read-only display
- Public visibility encourages competition
- Links to battle history (future)

**Upgrades:**
- Deliberate, infrequent action
- Confirmation via button click
- Cost clearly displayed

### Accessibility

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
- Color is not the only means of conveying information (icons + text)
- Sufficient contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum for text)
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Focus indicators on all focusable elements

**Decimal Value Accessibility:**
- Screen readers announce "25.50" as "twenty-five point five zero"
- Consistent decimal formatting prevents confusion
- Tooltips provide context for fractional values

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Backend Tests:**
```typescript
describe('Decimal Attribute Calculations', () => {
  it('should calculate 5% weapon bonus on 10 base as 10.50', () => {
    const robot = createTestRobot({ combatPower: 10 });
    const weapon = createTestWeapon({ combatPowerBonus: 0.5 }); // 5%
    const effective = calculateEffectiveStats(robot);
    expect(effective.combatPower).toBe(10.50);
  });
  
  it('should apply loadout modifier to decimal values', () => {
    const robot = createTestRobot({ 
      combatPower: 10.50,
      loadoutType: 'two_handed' 
    });
    const effective = calculateEffectiveStats(robot);
    // 10.50 × 1.25 = 13.125 → 13.12 (rounded)
    expect(effective.combatPower).toBe(13.12);
  });
  
  it('should round to 2 decimal places', () => {
    const result = calculateEffectiveStat(10, 0.333, 0.15);
    // 10.333 × 1.15 = 11.88295 → 11.88
    expect(result).toBe(11.88);
  });
});
```

**Frontend Tests:**
```typescript
describe('EffectiveStatsTable', () => {
  it('should display decimal values correctly', () => {
    const robot = createMockRobot({ combatPower: 25.50 });
    render(<EffectiveStatsTable robot={robot} />);
    expect(screen.getByText('25.50')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  it('should show all modifier columns', () => {
    const { container } = render(<EffectiveStatsTable robot={robot} />);
    expect(container.querySelectorAll('th')).toHaveLength(7); // 7 columns
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

**API Tests:**
```typescript
describe('GET /api/robots/:id', () => {
  it('should return decimal attributes as strings', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/api/robots/1')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);
    
    expect(response.body.combatPower).toBe('25.50');
    expect(typeof response.body.combatPower).toBe('string');
  });
});

describe('PUT /api/robots/:id/upgrade', () => {
  it('should upgrade attribute maintaining decimal precision', async () => {
    // Robot has 25.50 combat power (25 base + 0.50 from weapon)
    const response = await request(app)
      .put('/api/robots/1/upgrade')
      .send({ attribute: 'combatPower' })
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);
    
    // After upgrade: 26.50 (26 base + 0.50 from weapon)
    expect(response.body.robot.combatPower).toBe('26.50');
  });
});
```

### E2E Tests

**Playwright Tests:**
```typescript
test('decimal stats display correctly in stat table', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/robots/1');
  
  // Check that decimal values are displayed
  await expect(page.locator('text=25.50')).toBeVisible();
  
  // Check table structure
  const table = page.locator('[data-testid="effective-stats-table"]');
  await expect(table.locator('th')).toHaveCount(7);
  
  // Check modifier columns show percentage
  await expect(table.locator('text=+15%')).toBeVisible();
});

test('page layout shows clear section separation', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/robots/1');
  
  // Verify sections exist
  await expect(page.locator('text=⚔️ BATTLE CONFIGURATION')).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.locator('text=📊 EFFECTIVE STATS OVERVIEW')).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.locator('text=🏆 PERFORMANCE & STATISTICS')).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.locator('text=⬆️ UPGRADE ROBOT')).toBeVisible();
  
  // Verify credit balance NOT duplicated in page body
  const creditBalanceCount = await page.locator('text=Credits Balance').count();
  expect(creditBalanceCount).toBe(0); // Should only be in navigation banner
});
```

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Decimal Math Complexity

**Risk**: Floating-point precision issues in JavaScript  
**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation**:
- Use `Math.round(value * 100) / 100` for consistent 2-decimal rounding
- Avoid comparison with `===` for decimals; use tolerance: `Math.abs(a - b) < 0.01`
- Comprehensive unit tests for edge cases

### Risk 2: Database Migration Failure

**Risk**: Migration corrupts data or fails mid-process  
**Likelihood**: Very Low  
**Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**:
- Full database backup before migration
- Test migration on staging environment first
- Rollback procedure documented and tested
- Monitor migration with transaction logging

### Risk 3: User Confusion with Decimals

**Risk**: Players confused by fractional attribute values  
**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: Low  
**Mitigation**:
- Clear tooltips explaining decimal values
- "Why decimals?" help text in FAQ
- Visual examples showing benefit of fractional stats
- User education in patch notes

### Risk 4: Performance Degradation

**Risk**: Decimal calculations slower than integer math  
**Likelihood**: Very Low  
**Impact**: Low  
**Mitigation**:
- JavaScript handles decimals efficiently (no measurable difference)
- Performance profiling during testing phase
- Benchmarking: current vs. new calculations

### Risk 5: Page Redesign Rejected by Users

**Risk**: Users prefer old layout, find new one confusing  
**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation**:
- User testing before full deployment
- Gradual rollout (beta testers first)
- Feedback collection mechanism
- A/B testing if needed

## Open Questions

### Q1: Should effective stats table show stance modifiers by default?

**Options:**
A. Always show stance modifiers (current stance applied)
B. Show stance as separate column (all three stances)
C. Toggle between "Current Stance" and "All Stances" views

**Recommendation**: Option A (always show current stance)  
**Reasoning**: Simpler UX, focused on current battle readiness. Option C could be future enhancement.

### Q2: How to handle decimal display in battle logs?

**Context**: Battle logs will show damage, defense, etc. Should these be integers or decimals?

**Options:**
A. Round to integers for battle logs (25.67 → 26 damage dealt)
B. Show decimals in battle logs for accuracy

**Recommendation**: Option A (integers in logs)  
**Reasoning**: Cleaner, more "game-like" feel. Decimals in stats are for planning, not battle narrative.

### Q3: Should we add sorting/filtering to effective stats table?

**Context**: Table has 23 rows. Should users be able to sort by attribute or filter by category?

**Options:**
A. Static table (no sorting/filtering)
B. Add sort buttons to column headers
C. Add category filter chips

**Recommendation**: Option A for initial release, Option C as future enhancement  
**Reasoning**: Not critical for single robot view; adds complexity. Revisit if users request it.

### Q4: Performance statistics: Should visitors see economic data?

**Context**: Should `totalRepairsPaid` and `repairCost` be visible to other users?

**Options:**
A. Show all stats to everyone (fully transparent)
B. Hide economic data from non-owners
C. Show only aggregate stats (e.g., "High repair costs" label)

**Recommendation**: Option B (hide economic data)  
**Reasoning**: Economic information is sensitive; battle stats are competitive, repair costs are not.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Decimal Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Weapon Bonus at Low Level**
```
Base Attribute: 10
Weapon Bonus: +5% (0.50 absolute)
Calculation: 10 + 0.50 = 10.50
Display: "10.50"
```

**Example 2: Weapon + Loadout Modifier**
```
Base Attribute: 15
Weapon Bonus: +3
Loadout Modifier: +15% (two_handed)
Calculation: (15 + 3) × 1.15 = 18 × 1.15 = 20.70
Display: "20.70"
```

**Example 3: Full Stack (Weapon + Loadout + Stance)**
```
Base Attribute: 25
Weapon Bonus: +5
Loadout Modifier: +15% (weapon_shield armor bonus)
Stance Modifier: +15% (defensive stance armor bonus)
Calculation: (25 + 5) × 1.15 × 1.15 = 30 × 1.3225 = 39.675
Rounded: 39.67 (Math.round(39.675 × 100) / 100)
Display: "39.67"
```

### Appendix B: Page Layout Wireframes

[Wireframes would be included here in the actual document, showing:]
- Current layout (for comparison)
- New layout (full page)
- Effective stats table detail
- Compact attribute row detail
- Performance statistics section detail

### Appendix C: Database Schema Comparison

**Before (Integer Attributes):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE robots (
  combat_power INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  targeting_systems INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  -- ... 21 more INTEGER attributes
);
```

**After (Decimal Attributes):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE robots (
  combat_power DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 1.00,
  targeting_systems DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 1.00,
  -- ... 21 more DECIMAL attributes
);
```

**Storage Impact:**
- Before: 23 attributes × 4 bytes = 92 bytes
- After: 23 attributes × 5 bytes = 115 bytes
- Increase: +23 bytes per robot (+25% attribute storage, <1% total row size)
