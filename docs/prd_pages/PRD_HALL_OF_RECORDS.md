## Known Issues

### Issue #1: Biggest ELO Loss Query
**Status**: ⚠️ Bug in Implementation

**Current Behavior**: The "Biggest ELO Loss" record uses the same query as "Biggest ELO Gain" (lines 207-221 in `records.ts`), so it shows the same data.

**Expected Behavior**: Should find the battle where the loser had the largest ELO decrease.

**Fix Required**:
```typescript
// Should query for battles where loser had biggest ELO drop
const biggestEloLoss = await prisma.battle.findFirst({
  where: {
    winnerId: { not: null },
    eloChange: { gt: 0 },
  },
  orderBy: { eloChange: 'desc' }, // This finds biggest gain for winner = biggest loss for loser
  include: { /* ... */ },
});
```

**Impact**: Low - record displays but shows incorrect data (duplicate of ELO Gain)

---

## Technical Specification

### API Endpoint ✅ Implemented

**Route:** `GET /api/records`

**Response Format:**

  "combat": {
    "fastestVictory": {
      "battle": { ... },
      "winner": { ... },

  },
  "prestige": {
    "highestPrestige": { ... },
    "mostTitles": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Database Queries ✅ Implemented

All queries implemented using Prisma ORM with:
- ✅ Type safety (TypeScript interfaces)
- ✅ Error handling (try-catch with logging)
- ✅ Performance optimization (indexed fields: `elo`, `totalBattles`, `fame`, `prestige`, `currency`)
- ✅ Null handling (returns null for missing records)
- ✅ "Bye Robot" filtering (excluded from career records)
- ⚠️ Real-time updates (no caching - consider adding for Phase 2)

**Database Indexes Used** (from DATABASE_SCHEMA.md):
- Robot: `@@index([elo])`, `@@index([currentLeague])`
- Battle: `@@index([createdAt])`
- User: No specific indexes for currency/prestige (consider adding)

**Performance Considerations**:
- Most queries use simple `findFirst` with `orderBy` (efficient)
- Some queries iterate all battles (e.g., Most Damage, Narrowest Victory) - consider optimization for large datasets
- No pagination on records endpoint (returns all 17 records at once)

### Visual Design
- **Theme:** Dark mode consistent with existing pages
- **Accent Color:** Gold/yellow for record values (prestige feel)
- **Card Style:** Elevated cards with hover effects
- **Icons:** Trophy, medal, flame icons for different record types

### Layout

---

## Privacy Considerations

- All records are public information (battles are public)
- Robot names and usernames are already public in battle history
- For "Biggest ELO Loss" - consider if this should be displayed (could embarrass players)
  - **Recommendation:** Include it but frame it as "highest stakes" rather than "biggest failure"

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Performance & Caching
1. **Caching Strategy:** Cache records for 5-15 minutes to reduce database load
   - Use Redis or in-memory cache
   - Invalidate cache when new battles complete
   - Add `Cache-Control` headers to API response
   
2. **Query Optimization:** Optimize queries that iterate all battles
   - Add database indexes for `currency` and `prestige` on User table
   - Consider materialized views for complex aggregations
   - Use database-level MAX/MIN functions where possible

3. **Loading States:** Add skeleton loaders while fetching records
   - Improve perceived performance
   - Better UX on slow connections

### Phase 3: Personalization
4. **Personal Records:** Show user's own records and how they compare
   - "You're #5 in Most Battles Fought"
   - Highlight user's robots in record cards
   - Show distance to next record ("23 battles away from #1")

5. **Record Attempts:** Badge/notification when you're close to breaking a record
   - "You're 2 ELO points away from Biggest ELO Gain!"
   - Encourage strategic play to break records

6. **Personal Best Tracking:** Track each user's personal bests
   - Fastest victory for this user
   - Highest damage for this user
   - Compare personal bests to global records

### Phase 4: Social & Competitive
7. **Record History:** Track when records are broken with notifications
   - Timeline of record holders
   - "This record has been broken 3 times this month"
   - Notification when your record is broken

8. **Social Sharing:** Share record achievements on social media
   - Generate shareable images with record details
   - "I just set the record for Fastest Victory in Armoured Souls!"
   - Include QR code or link to battle details

9. **Record Alerts:** Notify players when their records are broken
   - In-app notifications
   - Email notifications (optional)
   - Push notifications (mobile)

10. **Leaderboard Integration:** Link to full leaderboards
    - "View Top 10 Fastest Victories"
    - Expand each record to show top 5-10 holders
    - Filter by league tier or time period

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
11. **Seasonal Records:** Reset records each season for fresh competition

    - Best comeback (largest HP deficit overcome)
    - Most efficient robot (highest damage per HP lost)
    - Longest win streak
    - Longest undefeated streak in a league

17. **Record Verification:** Add verification for suspicious records
    - Flag potential exploits or bugs
    - Admin review for exceptional records
    - Community reporting for suspicious achievements

---

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- Requires battle data to exist (at least 50+ battles for meaningful records)
- Requires Prisma database access
- Requires authentication middleware

### Risks
1. **Insufficient Data:** Early game may not have impressive records
   - Mitigation: Start with seed data or simulated battles
2. **Performance:** Complex queries on large battle tables
   - Mitigation: Add database indexes, implement caching
3. **Player Toxicity:** Public failures could discourage players
   - Mitigation: Frame negatives as "learning opportunities" or remove them

---

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests
- Test each record calculation function independently
- Test edge cases (ties, no data, etc.)

### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoint returns correct data structure
- Test with various database states (empty, partial, full)

### Manual Testing
- Verify UI displays correctly on desktop and mobile
- Test navigation integration
- Verify links to battle details work
- Test loading and error states

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Must Have**
- Page accessible from navigation
- Displays at least 10 different records
- Responsive design works on mobile
- Loading and error states handled
- Links to battle details functional

✅ **Should Have**
- Category tabs for organization
- Professional, polished UI
- Fast page load (<2 seconds)
- Accurate data with proper calculations

✅ **Nice to Have**
- Animations and visual polish
- Tooltips explaining each record type
- Personal record indicators ("You're #5 in this category!")

---

## Open Questions

1. Should we display records that might embarrass players (e.g., biggest loss)?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes, but frame positively ("Most Epic Upset")

2. Should records be real-time or cached?
   - **Recommendation:** Cache for 1 hour (balance freshness vs. performance)

3. Should we set minimum thresholds (e.g., "min 50 battles" for win rate)?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes, prevents flukes and meaningless records

4. Should users be able to opt-out of appearing in records?
   - **Recommendation:** No for MVP (all battle data is already public)

---

## Conclusion

The Hall of Records adds a competitive, aspirational element to Armoured Souls that encourages diverse strategies, long-term engagement, and creates memorable moments. By highlighting exceptional performances, we give players clear goals to strive for and stories to share.

The feature leverages existing battle data with minimal new infrastructure, making it a high-value, low-effort addition to the game.
