## Executive Summary

The Facilities Page (`/facilities`) is a critical economic and progression interface where players invest in their stable's infrastructure to unlock discounts, expand capacity, and increase attribute caps. Currently, the page displays all 14 facility types in a basic 2-column grid without clear organization or visual hierarchy. This PRD defines requirements for improving the UX through logical grouping, clear implementation status, and visual enhancements.

**Key Design Challenges:**
- **Lack of Organization**: 14 facilities displayed in flat list without logical grouping
- **Implementation Clarity**: Users need to know which facilities are functional vs. planned
- **Visual Identity**: No icons or imagery to help distinguish facility types
- **Information Density**: Each facility card repeats similar information patterns
- **Progression Tracking**: Difficult to see overall stable development at a glance

**Success Criteria**: 
- Facilities are logically grouped by function (Economy, Capacity, Training, Future Features)
- Implementation status is immediately visible (implemented vs. not yet implemented)
- Users can quickly identify which facilities to prioritize based on their strategy
- Visual design aligns with Armoured Souls design system
- Image requirements are documented for future asset creation
- Page maintains responsive design on mobile and desktop

**Impact**: Establishes clear organization and visual hierarchy for the primary stable management interface, improving player understanding of facility benefits and investment decisions.

  benefits: string[];
  implemented: boolean;
  prestigeRequirements?: number[]; // NEW: Prestige required for each level (sparse array)
}
```

**Example Implementation**:
```typescript
{
  type: 'training_facility',
  name: 'Training Facility',
  description: 'Reduces costs for upgrading robot attributes',
  maxLevel: 10,
  costs: [150000, 300000, 450000, 600000, 750000, 900000, 1100000, 1400000, 1750000, 2250000],
  benefits: [...],
  implemented: true,
  prestigeRequirements: [
    undefined, // Level 1: no prestige required
    undefined, // Level 2: no prestige required
    undefined, // Level 3: no prestige required
    1000,      // Level 4: 1,000 prestige required
    undefined, // Level 5: no prestige required
    undefined, // Level 6: no prestige required
    5000,      // Level 7: 5,000 prestige required
    undefined, // Level 8: no prestige required
    10000,     // Level 9: 10,000 prestige required
    undefined, // Level 10: no prestige required
  ],
}
```

#### 6.4.2 Upgrade Validation

**Update `POST /api/facilities/upgrade` endpoint:**

```typescript
// Pseudo-code for validation
async function upgradeFacility(userId: string, facilityType: string) {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });
  const facility = await getUserFacility(userId, facilityType);
  const config = getFacilityConfig(facilityType);
  
  const targetLevel = facility.level + 1;
  
  // NEW: Check prestige requirement
  if (config.prestigeRequirements && config.prestigeRequirements[targetLevel - 1]) {
    const requiredPrestige = config.prestigeRequirements[targetLevel - 1];
    if (user.prestige < requiredPrestige) {
      throw new Error(
        `Insufficient prestige. Required: ${requiredPrestige}, You have: ${user.prestige}`
      );
    }
  }
  
  // Existing credit validation
  const cost = config.costs[targetLevel - 1];
  if (user.credits < cost) {
    throw new Error('Insufficient credits');
  }
  
  // Perform upgrade...
}
```

#### 6.4.3 API Response Enhancement

**`GET /api/facility` response structure:**

```typescript
interface FacilityAPIResponse {
  facilities: FacilityResponse[];  // Array of facility objects
  userPrestige: number;             // User's current prestige
  userCurrency: number;             // User's current currency
  robotCount: number;               // Number of robots (for repair bay discount calculation)
}

interface FacilityResponse {
  type: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  currentLevel: number;
  maxLevel: number;
  currentBenefit: string | null;
  nextLevelBenefit: string | null;
  upgradeCost: number | null;
  implemented: boolean;
  // Prestige fields:
  prestigeRequired: number | null;  // Prestige required for next level
  prestigeMet: boolean;              // Whether user has enough prestige
  canUpgrade: boolean;               // Credits AND prestige requirements met
  canAfford: boolean;                // Whether user has enough currency
  hasPrestige: boolean;              // Whether user meets prestige requirement
}
```

**Note**: The endpoint returns an object containing the facilities array plus user context data, not a bare array. This enables the frontend to display user prestige and currency without additional API calls.
```

### 6.5 Frontend Requirements

#### 6.5.1 Component Updates

**FacilityCard Component:**
- Display lock icon if `prestigeRequired > 0 && !prestigeMet`
- Show prestige requirement text
- Disable upgrade button if `!canUpgrade`
- Add prestige progress tooltip

**FacilitiesPage Component:**
- Fetch user prestige from API
- Pass prestige data to facility cards
- Display user's current prestige in page header

#### 6.5.2 User Prestige Display

**Add to page header:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Facilities                                                   │
│ Your Prestige: 750 ⭐ (Novice)                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 6.6 Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests:**
- Prestige validation logic
- FacilityConfig with prestigeRequirements
- API response includes prestige fields

**Integration Tests:**
- Upgrade blocked when prestige insufficient
- Upgrade succeeds when prestige sufficient
- Error messages display correctly

**UI Tests:**
- Lock icons display on locked facilities
- Tooltips show prestige requirements
- Upgrade button disabled state

### 6.7 Implementation Priority

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)

**Rationale**: 
- Prestige gates are documented in STABLE_SYSTEM.md as core progression mechanic
- Without enforcement, players can bypass intended progression
- Creates strategic depth and long-term goals

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
- Backend: 1 day (config updates, validation, API changes)
- Frontend: 1-2 days (UI components, tooltips, testing)

---

### 5. Technical Implementation

#### 5.1 Component Structure

**Current:**
```
FacilitiesPage.tsx
├─ Navigation
├─ Error display
├─ Loading state
└─ Facilities grid (flat list)
```

**Enhanced:**
```
FacilitiesPage.tsx
├─ Navigation
├─ StableOverview (new component)
│  ├─ Total investment
│  ├─ Facilities upgraded count
│  └─ Implementation coverage
├─ CategoryNavigation (new component)
│  └─ Category quick links
├─ FacilityCategory (new component) × 4
│  ├─ CategoryHeader
│  │  ├─ Category icon
│  │  ├─ Category name
│  │  ├─ Category description
│  │  └─ Implementation count
│  └─ FacilityCard × N
│     ├─ Facility icon
│     ├─ Implementation status badge
│     ├─ Progress bar
│     ├─ Benefits display
│     └─ Upgrade button
```

#### 5.2 Data Structure Changes

**Current:** Facilities returned as flat array from API

**Enhanced:** Add category information to each facility

```typescript
interface FacilityWithCategory extends Facility {
  category: 'economy' | 'capacity' | 'training' | 'advanced';
  categoryPriority: number; // Order within category
  strategicValue: 'essential' | 'important' | 'advanced';
}
```

**Group facilities client-side:**
```typescript
const facilitiesByCategory = {
  economy: facilities.filter(f => f.category === 'economy'),
  capacity: facilities.filter(f => f.category === 'capacity'),
  training: facilities.filter(f => f.category === 'training'),
  advanced: facilities.filter(f => f.category === 'advanced'),
};
```

#### 5.3 Backend Changes Required

**Minimal Backend Changes:**
- No database schema changes needed
- No API endpoint changes needed
- Frontend handles all categorization logic
- Backend `facilities.ts` config can add category metadata (optional)

**Optional Backend Enhancement:**
```typescript
// In facilities.ts config
export const FACILITY_CATEGORIES = {
  economy: {
    name: 'Economy & Discounts',
    description: 'Reduce operational costs and maximize your budget',
    icon: 'currency',
  },
  // ... other categories
};

// Add category field to FacilityConfig
export interface FacilityConfig {
  // ... existing fields
  category: 'economy' | 'capacity' | 'training' | 'advanced';
  categoryPriority: number;
}
```

#### 5.4 Image Integration

**Phase 1: Placeholder Icons (Immediate - Current)**
```typescript
const facilityIcons: Record<string, string> = {
  training_facility: '🏋️',
  weapons_workshop: '🔧',
  repair_bay: '🔩',
  // ... etc.
};

// In FacilityCard component
<div className="text-4xl">{facilityIcons[facility.type]}</div>
```

**Phase 2: WebP with SVG Fallback (Primary Implementation)**

**Component Pattern:**
```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

interface FacilityIconProps {
  facilityType: string;
  alt: string;
  className?: string;
}

const FacilityIcon: React.FC<FacilityIconProps> = ({ facilityType, alt, className }) => {
  const webpSrc = `/assets/facilities/facility-${facilityType}-icon.webp`;
  const svgSrc = `/assets/facilities/facility-${facilityType}-icon.svg`;
  
  return (
    <picture>
      <source srcSet={webpSrc} type="image/webp" />
      <img 
        src={svgSrc} 
        alt={alt}
        className={className || "w-16 h-16"}
        loading="lazy"
      />
    </picture>
  );
};

// Usage in FacilityCard
<FacilityIcon 
  facilityType={facility.type}
  alt={facility.name}
  className="w-16 h-16"
/>
```

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari): Load WebP for optimal quality
- Older browsers: Automatically fallback to SVG
- Lazy loading: Defer off-screen images for performance

**File Structure:**
```
/prototype/frontend/src/assets/facilities/
├── facility-training-facility-icon.webp    (256×256px)
├── facility-training-facility-icon.svg     (fallback)
├── facility-weapons-workshop-icon.webp     (256×256px)
├── facility-weapons-workshop-icon.svg      (fallback)
└── ... (28 files total)
```

## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### 1. Facility Icon Art Direction
**Question**: Should facility icons use realistic/detailed art style or simple/iconic style?  
**Options**:
- A) Detailed realistic icons (matches robot aesthetics)
- B) Simple iconic symbols (faster to create, scales better at small sizes)
- C) Hybrid approach (simple shapes with detailed textures)

**Owner Response**: Icons can be AI-generated as needed. Production cost is not a concern.

**Recommendation**: Start with Option B (simple iconic) for Phase 1, use AI generation for quick iteration.

### 2. Category Navigation & Collapsing
**Question**: Should categories be collapsible to reduce page length?  
**Options**:
- A) All categories always expanded (current scroll length ~doubled)
- B) All categories collapsible, remember user preference
- C) Advanced features category collapsed by default, others expanded

**Owner Response**: Navigation bar is proposed to enable quick jumping between categories without scrolling. This is the primary solution for page length management.

**Recommendation**: Option C - Collapse "Advanced Features" by default since they are not implemented. Navigation bar provides quick access without scrolling.

### 3. Not-Implemented Facility Display
**Question**: How prominently should not-yet-implemented facilities be shown?  
**Options**:
- A) Full display with large "Coming Soon" badge (current approach)
- B) Reduced opacity and moved to bottom of category
- C) Collapsible "Coming Soon" section that hides them by default
- D) Only show implemented facilities, list others in "Roadmap" section

**Owner Response**: All facilities except "Advanced Features" are implemented. Advanced Features can go in a separate collapsed section.

**Recommendation**: Option C - Advanced Features category collapsed by default with clear "Coming Soon" indicators. All 10 implemented facilities displayed prominently.

### 4. Mobile Category Navigation
**Question**: How should category navigation work on mobile screens?  
**Options**:
- A) Horizontal scrollable button bar
- B) Dropdown select menu
- C) No category nav, users scroll normally
- D) Floating "Jump to" button that opens category selector

**Recommendation**: Option A for tablets, Option D for phones (< 640px).

## 7. Onboarding Integration: Facility Purchase Blocking & Priority Highlighting

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Reference**: See [PRD_ONBOARDING_SYSTEM.md](PRD_ONBOARDING_SYSTEM.md) for complete onboarding system specification.

During the new player onboarding tutorial, the Facilities Page has special behavior to prevent premature spending and guide new players toward optimal facility investments.

### 7.1 Facility Purchase Blocking During Onboarding

**Condition**: When the user's `onboardingStep < 4` (before the Budget Allocation Guidance step)

**Behavior**:
- All facility upgrade buttons are disabled
- A prominent explanation message is displayed at the top of the Facilities Page:
  ```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ 📋 Complete Tutorial First                                   │
  │                                                              │
  │ Facility purchases are locked until you complete the        │
  │ Budget Allocation step of the tutorial. This ensures you    │
  │ understand facility timing and priority before investing.   │
  │                                                              │
  │ [Return to Tutorial]                                         │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```
- Individual facility cards show a lock indicator on the upgrade button
- The explanation emphasizes that facility timing matters: "You can spend your money only once"
- After the player reaches onboarding Step 4 or later, facility purchases are unblocked

**Backend Validation**:
- `POST /api/facilities/upgrade` returns a `403` error with code `ONBOARDING_FACILITY_BLOCKED` if `onboardingStep < 4`
- Error message: "Complete the Budget Allocation step before purchasing facilities"

### 7.2 Facility Priority Highlighting for New Players

**Condition**: When the user's `hasCompletedOnboarding = false` and `onboardingStep >= 4`

**Behavior**:
- Facilities are highlighted based on the player's chosen roster strategy (`onboardingStrategy`)
- Priority highlighting uses colored left borders on facility cards:
  - **Green border** (`border-green-500`): Mandatory First facilities for the chosen strategy
  - **Blue border** (`border-blue-500`): Recommended Early facilities
  - **No special border**: Optional/Later facilities

**Strategy-Specific Priorities**:

| Facility | 1 Mighty | 2 Average | 3 Flimsy |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Roster Expansion | Optional | Mandatory First | Mandatory First |
| Weapons Workshop | Recommended Early | Mandatory First | Mandatory First |
| Training Facility | Mandatory First | Recommended Early | Optional |
| Storage Facility | Optional | Recommended Early | Mandatory First |
| Repair Bay | Recommended Early | Recommended Early | Mandatory First |

- A small tooltip on highlighted facilities explains: "Recommended for your {strategy} strategy"
- Priority highlighting is removed once `hasCompletedOnboarding = true`

### 7.3 Integration with Onboarding Step 3 (Facility Timing Education)

During onboarding Step 3, the tutorial teaches facility timing and priority through the `FacilityPriorityList` component. This step:
- Explains the concept of "you can spend your money only once"
- Shows facility categories: Mandatory First, Recommended Early, Strategy-Dependent, Optional/Later
- Displays concrete savings examples (e.g., Weapons Workshop Level 1 saves 5% on all weapon purchases)
- Uses existing `FacilityIcon` components for visual consistency with the Facilities Page

After completing Step 3, the player has context for why certain facilities are highlighted when they visit the Facilities Page.
