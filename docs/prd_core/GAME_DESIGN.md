# Armoured Souls - Game Design Document

**Last Updated**: February 9, 2026

## Overview

This document captures the core game design decisions for Armoured Souls, a strategy-based robot battle management game inspired by Football Manager mechanics.

**Implementation Status**: This document now includes implementation status markers (✅ Implemented, 🚧 Partial, ❌ Not Started) to track progress against the original design vision.

---

## Core Game Concept

**Genre**: Strategy Simulation / Management Game  
**Inspiration**: Football Manager (soccer management) - players manage input variables, AI processes outcomes  
**Target Audience**: Casual players (ages 15-100)  
**Session Length**: 15-30 minutes per day  
**Gameplay Style**: Asynchronous scheduled battles

---

## Battle System

### Battle Mechanics - ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Format**: Scheduled, simulation-based battles
- Battles are **not real-time** and **not turn-based** ✅
- Players set up robots with stats, weapons, and configurations ✅
- Battles are scheduled at specific times ✅
- All scheduled battles are processed simultaneously by the simulation engine ✅
- Results are then presented to players ✅

**Battle Processing**: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
1. Players configure their robots and select opponents/join queues ✅
2. Battles are scheduled for specific processing times (automated via admin cycle) ✅
3. Server runs all scheduled battles using simulation engine ✅
4. Results, replays, and statistics are generated ✅
5. Players log in to view outcomes and adjust strategies ✅

**Battle Duration**: ✅ Time-based combat system implemented with cooldowns and timestamps

**Player Control**:
- **Pre-Battle**: ✅ Full control over robot configuration, weapon selection, stance, and yield threshold
- **During Battle**: ✅ No manual intervention (automated based on pre-configured settings)
- **Future Feature**: ❌ Conditional triggers (e.g., "activate mega-ultra-destructive BFG9000 on turn 7" or "after 3 minutes" or "when badly damaged")

---

## Robot System

### Robot Customization - ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Customization Depth**: ✅ Framework-based system with 23 weapon-neutral attributes
- Balance between complexity (interesting gameplay) and simplicity (not overwhelming) ✅
- Both functionality-driven (stats, performance) and visual customization ✅

**Robot Components**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Chassis (determines base stats and size) ✅
- Weapons (primary and secondary with 20 weapons + 3 shields) ✅
- 23 core attributes across 5 categories:
  - Combat Systems (6 attributes) ✅
  - Defensive Systems (5 attributes) ✅
  - Chassis & Mobility (5 attributes) ✅
  - AI Processing (4 attributes) ✅
  - Team Coordination (3 attributes) ✅
- Loadout types: single, weapon_shield, two_handed, dual_wield ✅
- Battle stances: offensive, defensive, balanced ✅
- Yield threshold configuration (0-50% HP) ✅

**Robot Templates**:
- **Visual-driven templates**: ❌ Not implemented (frameId exists but limited options)
- **Functionality-driven templates**: 🚧 Partial (players can configure attributes manually)
- Players can design from scratch ✅

**Balance Strategy**: ✅ ACTIVE
- Extensive simulation testing before launch ✅
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment post-launch ✅
- Player exploitation is expected - adapt through patches ✅
