## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Weapon Equipment API

**Backend Endpoints Required:**

```
PUT /api/robots/:robotId/equip-main-weapon
Body: { weaponInventoryId: number }
- Validates weapon belongs to user
- Validates weapon is not equipped to another robot
- Validates weapon is compatible with robot's loadout type
- Updates robot.mainWeaponId
- Recalculates and updates robot stats (maxHP, maxShield)
- Returns updated robot with weapon details

PUT /api/robots/:robotId/equip-offhand-weapon
Body: { weaponInventoryId: number }
- Same validations as main weapon
- Additional validation: loadout type supports offhand (weapon_shield, dual_wield)
- Updates robot.offhandWeaponId
- Recalculates stats
- Returns updated robot

DELETE /api/robots/:robotId/unequip-main-weapon
- Sets robot.mainWeaponId to null
- Recalculates stats
- Returns updated robot

DELETE /api/robots/:robotId/unequip-offhand-weapon
- Sets robot.offhandWeaponId to null
- Recalculates stats
- Returns updated robot

PUT /api/robots/:robotId/loadout-type
Body: { loadoutType: "single" | "weapon_shield" | "two_handed" | "dual_wield" }
- Validates loadout type is valid
- Checks weapon compatibility with new loadout
- If incompatible weapons equipped, returns error with details
- Updates robot.loadoutType
- Recalculates stats with new loadout bonuses
- Returns updated robot
```

**Validation Rules:**

1. **Weapon Ownership**: Weapon must belong to the user attempting to equip it
2. **Single Equipment**: A weapon can only be equipped to one robot at a time
3. **Loadout Compatibility**:
   - "single": Any one-handed weapon in main slot, nothing in offhand
   - "weapon_shield": One-handed weapon in main, shield-type weapon in offhand
   - "two_handed": Two-handed weapon in main slot, nothing in offhand
   - "dual_wield": One-handed weapon in main, one-handed weapon in offhand
4. **Weapon Type Restrictions**: 
   - Shield-type weapons can ONLY go in offhand slot with weapon_shield loadout
   - Main weapon must be equipped when an offhand shield is equipped (configuration cannot be incomplete)
5. **Storage Capacity**: 
   - Check total weapons owned (equipped + unequipped) against storage limit
   - Storage capacity = 5 + (Storage Facility Level × 5)
   - Maximum capacity: 55 weapons (Storage Facility Level 10)
   - This validation applies to weapon purchases, not equipment changes

### FR-2: Stat Calculation System

**Robot Effective Stats Formula:**
```
effective_stat = base_stat + main_weapon_bonus + offhand_weapon_bonus + loadout_bonus
```

**Loadout Bonuses (from ROBOT_ATTRIBUTES.md):**

- **weapon_shield**: +20% Shield Capacity, +15% Armor Plating, +10% Counter Protocols, -15% Attack Speed
- **two_handed**: +10% Combat Power (v1.2: reduced from +25%), +20% Critical Systems, -10% Evasion Thrusters, 1.10× damage multiplier (v1.2: reduced from 1.25×)
- **dual_wield**: +30% Attack Speed, +15% Weapon Control, -20% Penetration, -10% Combat Power
- **single**: +10% Gyro Stabilizers, +5% Servo Motors

**Implementation Notes:**
- Percentage bonuses are multiplicative: `final = base * (1 + bonus_percent / 100)`
- Weapon attribute bonuses are flat additions
- Stats must be recalculated whenever weapons or loadout changes
- maxHP and maxShield must be recalculated based on effective Hull Integrity and Shield Capacity

### FR-3: Frontend Weapon Equipment UI

**Robot Detail Page Enhancements:**

1. **Loadout Configuration Section** (new section above attributes)
   - Dropdown to select loadout type with descriptions
   - Display current loadout bonuses/penalties
   - Warning message if equipped weapons are incompatible

2. **Weapon Slots Section** (new section)
   - **Main Weapon Slot**: 
     - Shows currently equipped weapon (name, icon, bonuses) or "Empty"
     - "Change Weapon" button opens weapon selection modal
     - "Unequip" button if weapon is equipped
   - **Offhand Weapon Slot**:
     - Only visible if loadout supports offhand (weapon_shield, dual_wield)
     - Same UI as main weapon slot
     - "Equip Shield" button for weapon_shield loadout
     - "Equip Offhand Weapon" button for dual_wield loadout

3. **Weapon Selection Modal**:
   - List of available weapons from user's inventory
   - Filter by compatible weapons (based on loadout type and slot)
   - Show weapon details: name, type, damage, bonuses
   - Show if weapon is equipped to another robot (grayed out with "Equipped to [Name]")
   - "Equip" button for each compatible weapon
   - "Cancel" button to close without changes

4. **Stats Display Enhancement**:
   - Add "With Equipment" column next to base stats
   - Show: `Base | Weapon Bonus | Loadout Bonus | Effective`
   - Color code bonuses (green for positive, red for negative)

**Weapon Inventory Page (deprecated - integrated into Weapon Shop):**

Originally planned as separate page, but integrated into Weapon Shop for better UX via "Only Owned Weapons" filter.

### FR-4: Data Model Constraints

**Database Constraints (already in schema):**
- Robot.mainWeaponId → foreign key to WeaponInventory
- Robot.offhandWeaponId → foreign key to WeaponInventory
- Robot.loadoutType → enum values validated

**Business Logic Constraints:**
- Weapons cannot be equipped to multiple robots (enforced at API level)
- Loadout type changes must be validated against equipped weapons
- Stat calculations must be deterministic and consistent

---

## System Overview

### Core Principles

**Weapon Ownership Model:**
- Weapons are owned at the **stable level** (not robot-specific)
- Players purchase weapons using **Credits (₡)** from stable resources
- Each purchase creates a separate inventory item
- Players can own **multiple copies** of the same weapon
- Weapons can be **equipped** to robots or remain **available** in storage

**Weapon States:**
- **Available**: In storage, ready to equip
- **Equipped**: Assigned to a specific robot (main or offhand slot)
- **Restriction**: A weapon cannot be equipped to multiple robots simultaneously

**Storage Management:**
- **Default Capacity**: 5 weapons (Storage Facility Level 0)
- **Expansion**: +5 weapons per Storage Facility level
- **Formula**: Storage Capacity = 5 + (Storage Facility Level × 5)
- **Maximum**: 55 weapons (Storage Facility Level 10)
- **Definition**: Total weapons owned (both equipped AND unequipped)

---

## Loadout System

Robots are bipedal humanoids with two arms. Loadout determines how weapons/shields are equipped and provides strategic bonuses/penalties.

### Why Percentage-Based Bonuses?

Loadouts use **percentage-based bonuses** rather than flat bonuses for critical reasons:

1. **Power Scaling**: Percentages scale proportionally with robot level
2. **Meaningful Choices**: Remain strategically significant throughout progression
3. **Multiplicative Progression**: Creates interesting build variety
4. **Balance Maintenance**: Easier to balance once, applies fairly at all levels

### Loadout Configurations

#### 1. Weapon + Shield
- **Equipment**: One weapon + Shield weapon (offhand)
- **Bonuses**: +20% Shield Capacity, +15% Armor Plating, +10% Counter Protocols
- **Penalties**: -15% Attack Speed (shield weight)
- **Best For**: Tank builds, defensive strategies

#### 2. Two-Handed Weapon
- **Equipment**: One two-handed weapon (both hands)
- **Bonuses**: +10% Combat Power, +20% Critical Systems, 2.5× crit multiplier, 1.10× damage multiplier
- **Penalties**: -10% Evasion Thrusters (less mobility)
- **Best For**: Glass cannon builds, high burst damage

#### 3. Dual-Wield (Two Weapons)
- **Equipment**: Two one-handed weapons
- **Bonuses**: +30% Attack Speed, +15% Weapon Control
- **Penalties**: -20% Penetration, -10% Combat Power
- **Best For**: Speed builds, sustained DPS

#### 4. Single Weapon (No Shield)
- **Equipment**: One weapon, other hand free
- **Bonuses**: +10% Gyro Stabilizers, +5% Servo Motors
- **Penalties**: None
- **Best For**: Balanced builds, flexible strategies

### Weapon Compatibility Rules

**One-Handed Weapons (not shields):**
- Can be equipped in main hand OR offhand
- Compatible with: Single, Weapon+Shield (main only), Dual-Wield (both slots)
- NOT compatible with: Two-Handed loadout
- Can own multiple copies and equip same weapon to both slots (Dual-Wield)

**Two-Handed Weapons:**
- Require Two-Handed loadout
- Occupy both weapon slots
- NOT compatible with: Single, Weapon+Shield, Dual-Wield

**Shield Weapons:**

## Weapon Economy & Pricing

**⭐ AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE**: [PRD_WEAPON_ECONOMY_OVERHAUL.md](../PRD_WEAPON_ECONOMY_OVERHAUL.md)

### Current Economy (Option C - Feb 8, 2026)

**Starting Budget**: **₡3,000,000** (increased from ₡2M)

**Economic Changes:**
- Attribute Upgrade Costs: +50% (now level × 1,500)
- Facility Costs: -50% reduction
- Weapon Costs: +25% increase
- See [OPTION_C_IMPLEMENTATION.md](../OPTION_C_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for details

### Pricing Formula

All weapons use a **DPS-inclusive pricing formula** that factors in:
- **Base Cost**: ₡50,000 (Practice Sword baseline)
- **Attribute Bonuses**: Exponential scaling (₡500 × bonus²)
- **DPS Premium**: Higher damage/faster attacks cost more
- **Hand Multiplier**: 1.0× (one-handed), 1.6× (two-handed), 0.9× (shield)

**Complete Formula:**
```
Total Cost = (Base Cost + Attribute Cost + DPS Cost) × Hand Multiplier

Where:
- Base Cost = ₡50,000
- Attribute Cost = Σ(500 × bonus²) for all bonuses
- DPS Cost = ₡50,000 × (DPS Ratio - 1.0) × 3.0
- DPS Ratio = (weapon DPS) / (baseline DPS of 2.0)
- Hand Multiplier = 1.0, 1.6, or 0.9
```

**Key Insight**: Specialized weapons (high single attribute) cost MORE than balanced weapons due to exponential scaling.

See [PRD_WEAPON_ECONOMY_OVERHAUL.md](../PRD_WEAPON_ECONOMY_OVERHAUL.md) for complete formula details and examples.
