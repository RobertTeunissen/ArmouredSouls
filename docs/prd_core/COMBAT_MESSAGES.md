## Overview

This catalog defines all possible combat messages for the battle simulation system. Each event in a battle generates a human-readable text description that explains what happened.

**Design Principles**:
- Clear and descriptive language
- Consistent formatting
- Informative (uses damage descriptors, not raw numbers)
- Engaging (creates narrative flow)
- Supports replay understanding
- Players see their actual weapon names in combat

---

## Architecture

### Two Message Systems

The codebase has **two distinct message generation systems**:

1. **Combat Simulator** (`combatSimulator.ts`)
   - Produces raw technical events with exact damage numbers
   - Format: `💥 BattleBot Alpha hits for 45 damage with Laser Rifle (30 shield, 15 HP)`
   - Includes formula breakdowns for admin debugging
   - Stored in `detailedCombatEvents` for admin panel

2. **Combat Message Generator** (`combatMessageGenerator.ts`)
   - Converts raw simulator events into narrative player-facing messages
   - Format: `💥 BattleBot Alpha strikes Iron Crusher with Laser Rifle, landing a heavy strike!`
   - Multiple message variations per event type for variety
   - Stored in `battleLog.events` for player-facing display

### Event Flow

```
combatSimulator.ts → CombatEvent[] (raw technical events)
       ↓
combatMessageGenerator.ts → convertSimulatorEvents() → narrative events
       ↓
Stored in battle record as battleLog.events (player-facing)
```

### Orchestrator Integration

All three orchestrators now use the narrative conversion pipeline:

- **League** (`battleOrchestrator.ts`): Calls `generateBattleLog()` with `simulatorEvents`, which delegates to `convertSimulatorEvents()`
- **Tournament** (`tournamentBattleOrchestrator.ts`): Same as league, with `battleType: 'tournament'`
- **Tag Team** (`tagTeamBattleOrchestrator.ts`): Calls `convertTagTeamEvents()` which handles mixed arrays of raw simulator events and narrative tag_out/tag_in events, converting each combat phase separately

### Not Implemented ❌

| Category | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Weapon-Specific Messages | All weapons use generic attack messages (by design) |
| Overkill Messages | Not needed - simulator stops at 0 HP |
| Contextual Dramatic Messages | Comeback/domination commentary not prioritized |
| League Impact Messages | Shown in UI summary, not combat log |
| Yield Threshold Warnings | Would add noise to combat log |

---

## Damage Descriptor System

Instead of showing raw damage numbers, the narrative system uses descriptive text based on damage as a percentage of the defender's max HP:

| Threshold | Descriptor |
|-----------|-----------|
| ≥25% of max HP | "a devastating blow" |
| ≥15% of max HP | "a heavy strike" |
| ≥10% of max HP | "a solid hit" |
| ≥5% of max HP | "a moderate impact" |
| ≥2% of max HP | "a glancing blow" |
| <2% of max HP | "a minor scratch" |

## Damage Status Thresholds

Status messages are emitted once per threshold crossing (not repeated):

| Threshold | Severity | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| HP ≤25% | Heavy | "⚠️ {robotName} is heavily damaged - hull integrity critical!" |
| HP ≤50% | Moderate | "⚠️ {robotName} has taken significant damage!" |
| HP ≤75% | Light | "🟢 {robotName} sustains minor damage - still in fighting shape" |

## Shield Regeneration Events

The combat simulator now emits `shield_regen` events when a robot's shield crosses a 25% threshold (0→25%, 25→50%, 50→75%, 75→100%). This prevents spam while still showing meaningful shield recovery moments.

| Event Type | Border Color | Background |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| battle_start | Blue | Blue tint |
| battle_end | Green | Green tint |
| stance | Purple | Purple tint |
| critical | Red | Red tint |
