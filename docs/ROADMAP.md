## Future Ideas & Enhancements

Features and systems to consider for future development. These are not yet planned for specific phases.

### Design Discussions Needed

- **Prestige vs Fame System**:
  - **Current**: Prestige (stable-level) and Fame (robot-level) are separate
  - **Status**: ✅ **DESIGNED** - Comprehensive PRD completed (February 2, 2026)
  - **Documentation**: See [PRD_PRESTIGE_AND_FAME.md](PRD_PRESTIGE_AND_FAME.md) for complete specification
  - **Summary**:
    - Prestige: Stable-level permanent reputation, unlocks facilities and tournaments, earned from battles (5-75), tournaments (100-2,500), and milestones
    - Fame: Robot-level individual reputation, affects streaming income and matchmaking quality, earned from robot victories (2-40) and performance bonuses
    - Both systems integrated with income multipliers and unlock mechanics
    - Implementation plan: 5 phases (backend, API, frontend, testing, analytics)
  - **Next Steps**: Review PRD with team, prioritize implementation phases

- **Tournament System Design**:
  - **Current**: Tournaments mentioned but not fully detailed
  - **To Discuss**:
    - Tournament types (local, regional, championship, world)
    - Entry requirements (Credits cost, prestige threshold, ELO rating?)
    - Tournament structure (single elimination, Swiss, round-robin)
    - Reward structure (Credits, prestige, fame, exclusive items) - See [PRD_PRESTIGE_AND_FAME.md](PRD_PRESTIGE_AND_FAME.md)
    - How tournaments affect robot/stable rankings
    - Tournament frequency and scheduling
    - Special tournament rules and formats
  - **Status**: Requires comprehensive design specification

### Advanced Combat Mechanics
- **Range System**: Multiple range bands (short/medium/long) beyond just melee vs ranged
  - Different weapons perform better at different ranges
  - Positioning mechanics with range advantages
  - See ROBOT_ATTRIBUTES.md for melee/ranged distinction currently implemented
  - Robots can be upgraded to specialise in a specific loadout 

- **Status Effects System**: 
  - Stun, slow, buff, debuff mechanics
  - Duration-based effects
  - Cleanse/dispel abilities
  - Currently not implemented - combat is direct damage only

### Stable Enhancements (From STABLE_SYSTEM.md)
- **Stable vs Stable Wars**: Team battles between stables
- **Alliances**: Form alliances with other stables for shared bonuses
- **Stable Customization**: Custom logos, colors, banners
- **Staff Management**: Hire technicians, analysts, scouts
- **Sponsorships**: Stable sponsors provide Credits/bonuses in exchange for performance
- **Stable Rankings**: Global leaderboards for stables
- **Legacy System**: Retired robot bonuses, historical achievements
- **Training Programs**: Long-term attribute development options

### Additional Game Modes
- Arena battles (2v2, 3v3) with team coordination
- Tournaments with bracket systems (see Design Discussions above)
- Special events and challenges
- Seasonal leagues

## Dependencies & Risks

### Critical Path Items
1. ✅ Design decisions (battle mechanics, tech stack) - COMPLETE (January 24, 2026)
2. ✅ **Phase 1 Prototype** - COMPLETE (February 1, 2026) - Core game concept validated
3. ✅ Battle simulation engine - COMPLETE - Game loop functional and tested
4. 🟡 **Document review and UX overhaul** - IN PROGRESS
5. 🟡 **Friends' feedback** - PENDING - Will validate if we continue or pivot
6. ⚪ Authentication system (Phase 2) - Blocks production deployment
7. ⚪ Web UI polish (Phase 4) - Blocks public launch

### Known Risks
1. **Game Concept Validation**: Core gameplay might not be fun
   - Mitigation: ✅ **Phase 1 prototype completed - ready for friend validation**
   - Status: Prototype demonstrates functional and balanced gameplay

2. **Technology Stack Choice**: Choosing wrong tech could slow development
   - Mitigation: ✅ Prototype validated tech stack works well
   - Status: Express + Prisma + React + Tailwind proven effective

3. **Scope Creep**: Adding too many features before validation
   - Mitigation: ✅ **Strict Phase 1 scope maintained - core concept proven**
   - Status: All Phase 1 features complete, ready for next phase decision

4. **Performance at Scale**: System may not handle 1000+ concurrent users
   - Mitigation: Load testing planned for Phase 2, scalable architecture from start
   - Status: Tested with 341 robots across 102+ battle cycles

5. **Mobile Platform Differences**: iOS/Android specific issues
   - Mitigation: React Native for code sharing, platform-specific testing (Phase 8)
   - Status: Deferred to Phase 8

6. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Potential for exploits
   - Mitigation: Security-first design, regular audits (Phase 2+), automated scanning
   - Status: Basic security in place, production-grade security planned for Phase 2
