## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the complete economy system for Armoured Souls, covering all cost centers (what costs money), revenue streams (how stables earn money), and the daily financial reporting system. The economy system creates strategic depth by requiring players to balance investments, operating costs, and revenue generation while managing their stable and robot roster.

**Success Criteria**: Players understand all cost centers and revenue streams, can make informed economic decisions, and receive clear daily financial reports showing their stable's economic health.

## Economy Overview

### Currency System

**Primary Currency: Credits (₡)**
- Symbol: ₡ (Costa Rican colón symbol, chosen for robotic/technical aesthetic)
- Starting balance: **₡2,000,000** per player
- Precision: Whole numbers only (no decimals)
- Range: 0 to 999,999,999,999 (database supports up to ~2 billion)

**Secondary Resource: Prestige (Stable-Level)**
- **See [PRD_PRESTIGE_AND_FAME.md](PRD_PRESTIGE_AND_FAME.md)**
- Not a spendable currency - acts as unlock threshold
- Earned through victories, achievements, milestones, tournaments
- Never decreases (only increases)
- Used to unlock facility levels and high-tier content
- Scales merchandising income
- Provides battle winnings multiplier

**Tertiary Resource: Fame (Robot-Level)**
- **See [PRD_PRESTIGE_AND_FAME.md](PRD_PRESTIGE_AND_FAME.md)**
- Individual robot reputation (separate from stable prestige)
- Earned through individual robot victories with performance bonuses
- Tracked per robot, aggregated for stable-level calculations
- Used in streaming revenue calculations (aggregate)
- Displayed for competitive rankings

### Economic Philosophy

1. **Multiple Paths to Success**: Players can focus on quality (one powerful robot), quantity (multiple robots), or specialization (weapon trading, specific tournaments, 2v2 or other team battles)
2. **Meaningful Choices**: Every purchase should have trade-offs and alternatives
3. **Sustainable Operations**: Players should be able to run profitable stables with proper management
4. **Risk/Reward Balance**: Higher risks (low yield threshold, aggressive facilities) offer higher rewards
5. **Long-Term Planning**: Facility investments pay off over time, encouraging strategic thinking

## Cost Centers (What Costs Money)

All costs are paid in Credits (₡). This section consolidates every way players spend money.

### 1. Robot Acquisition & Upgrades

#### Robot Frame Purchase
- **Cost**: ₡500,000 per robot (bare metal chassis)
- **Includes**: Robot with all 23 attributes at level 1
- **Starting HP**: Full health (max HP determined by Hull Integrity attribute)
- **Starting Shields**: Full shields (max determined by Shield Capacity attribute)
- **One-time cost**: No recurring fees for owning robot

**Formula**:
```
robot_purchase_cost = 500,000 Credits
```

#### Attribute Upgrades
- **Formula**: `(current_level + 1) × 1,000` Credits per level
- **Range**: Level 1 → 50
- **23 Attributes Total** (see ROBOT_ATTRIBUTES.md for complete list)

**Examples**:
- Level 1→2: ₡2,000
- Level 2→3: ₡3,000
- Level 10→11: ₡11,000
- Level 49→50: ₡50,000

**Total Cost to Max One Attribute** (1→50):
```
sum = Σ(n+1) × 1,000 for n=1 to 49
    = (2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 50) × 1,000
    = 1,274 × 1,000
    = ₡1,274,000
```

**Total Cost to Max All 23 Attributes** (all 1→50):
```
total_max_cost = 23 × 1,274,000 = ₡29,302,000
```

**Facility Discount: Training Facility**
- Provides 5% to 50% discount based on level (see section 2 below)
- Discount applies to base upgrade cost before calculation
- Formula with discount:
  ```
  discount = training_facility_level × 5  // 0% to 50%
  upgrade_cost = (current_level + 1) × 1,000 × (1 - discount/100)
  ```

**Training Facility ROI Analysis**:

*Upgrading from level 1→10 (hitting first cap) for all 23 attributes:*
- Cost per attribute (1→10): (2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11) × ₡1,000 = ₡54,000
- Total for all 23 attributes: 23 × ₡54,000 = **₡1,242,000**

*With Training Facility Level 1 (5% discount):*
- Training Facility cost: ₡300,000
- Cost per attribute (1→10) with discount: ₡54,000 × 0.95 = ₡51,300
- Total for all 23 attributes: 23 × ₡51,300 = ₡1,179,900
- **Savings**: ₡1,242,000 - ₡1,179,900 = ₡62,100
- **Net cost with facility**: ₡300,000 + ₡1,179,900 = ₡1,479,900
- **vs without facility**: ₡1,242,000

**Conclusion**: Training Facility Level 1 is NOT cost-effective for early game (1→10 upgrades). It only becomes valuable when upgrading to higher levels or when upgrading multiple robots. 
**Recommendation**: Prioritize attribute upgrades first, purchase Training Facility later when preparing for level 15+ upgrades or when managing 2+ robots.

### 2. Facility Purchases & Upgrades

**14 Facility Types**, most with **10 upgrade levels** (Level 0 = not purchased, Levels 1-10 = upgraded). Some levels require prestige thresholds (Roster Expansion is the only facility with 9 levels. 

**Purchase Costs Summary** (Level 1 costs for each facility):

| Facility | Level 1 Cost | Operating Cost/Day |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1. Repair Bay | ₡200,000 | ₡1,000 |
| 2. Training Facility | ₡300,000 | ₡1,500 |
| 3. Weapons Workshop | ₡250,000 | ₡1,000 |
| 4. Research Lab | ₡400,000 | ₡2,000 |
| 5. Medical Bay | ₡350,000 | ₡2,000 |
| 6. Roster Expansion | ₡300,000 | ₡500/slot |
| 7. Storage Facility | ₡150,000 | ₡500 |
| 8. Coaching Staff | ₡500,000 | ₡3,000 when active |

| 11. Defense Training Academy | ₡400,000 | ₡800 |
| 12. Mobility Training Academy | ₡400,000 | ₡800 |
| 13. AI Training Academy | ₡500,000 | ₡1,000 |
| 14. Income Generator | ₡800,000 | ₡1,000 |

**Total Cost to Purchase All Facilities (Level 1)**: ₡5,450,000

**Upgrade Cost Scaling**:
- Most facilities: Cost increases by ~₡200K-₡400K per level
- Higher levels (7-10) often have prestige requirements
- Total cost to max one facility: ~₡2M-₡5M (varies by facility)

**See [STABLE_SYSTEM.md](STABLE_SYSTEM.md#facility-system) for complete facility details, level costs, and benefits.**

### 3. Weapon Purchases

**Phase 1 Implemented Weapons** (23 total):

> **For complete weapon catalog, pricing, and methodology**: See **[PRD_WEAPON_ECONOMY_OVERHAUL.md](PRD_WEAPON_ECONOMY_OVERHAUL.md)** - the authoritative document for weapon economy system (implemented in `prototype/backend/prisma/seed.ts`).

**Weapon Pricing Methodology**:

All weapons use an exponential pricing formula based on attribute bonuses and DPS (Damage Per Second):

1. **Base Price**: ₡50,000 (Practice Sword baseline)
2. **Exponential Scaling**: Higher attribute bonuses cost progressively more per point
3. **DPS Premium**: Weapons with high damage and low cooldown cost more
4. **No Special Properties**: All special properties removed (not implemented in combat system)

**Weapon Price Range**: ₡50,000 (Practice Sword) to ₡600,000+ (Elite two-handed weapons)

**Key Weapon Categories**:
- **Budget One-Handed** (₡50K-₡150K): Practice Sword, Combat Knife, Machine Gun, Laser Rifle, Shock Baton
- **Mid-Tier One-Handed** (₡150K-₡250K): Power Sword, Plasma Blade, Gatling Gun
- **Premium One-Handed** (₡250K-₡400K): Disruptor Beam, Ion Blade
- **Shields** (₡100K-₡300K): Combat Shield, Energy Shield, Fortress Shield
- **Two-Handed** (₡150K-₡600K): Shotgun, Hammer, Railgun, Plasma Cannon, Ion Beam, Devastator Cannon

**Weapons vs Academy Investment**:
- **Academy** (₡400K-₡500K): Unlocks attribute cap 10→15 for 5-6 attributes in category
  - Allows +5 levels per attribute = potential +25-30 total attribute points across category
  - Permanent benefit, applies to all current and future robots
  - Has daily operating costs (₡800-₡1,000/day)
- **Premium Weapon** (₡300K-₡400K): Provides immediate +15-20 attribute points
  - Immediate benefit, can be swapped between robots
  - No operating cost
  - Can be sold or traded (future feature)

**Strategy Comparison**:
- **Early Game**: Budget weapons (₡50K-₡150K) provide power spike with low upfront cost
- **Mid Game**: Mix of mid-tier weapons (₡150K-₡250K) and first academy
- **Late Game**: Premium weapons (₡300K+) and multiple academies for attribute cap increases
- **Optimal**: Balanced portfolio - weapons for immediate power, academies for long-term scaling

**Loadout Strategy Examples**:
- **Dual Wield** (e.g., 2× Gatling Guns = 2×₡200K = ₡400K): High DPS, strong offense
- **Single Two-Handed** (e.g., Plasma Cannon = ₡400K): Balanced stats, high burst damage
- **Weapon + Shield** (e.g., Power Sword ₡200K + Energy Shield ₡200K = ₡400K): Balanced offense + defense

**Weapon Ownership**:
- Weapons are purchased and placed in stable's weapon storage
- Each purchase creates separate inventory item (can own multiple copies)
- Weapon can only be equipped to one robot at a time
- To use same weapon on multiple robots, purchase multiple copies

**Storage Limits**:
- Default capacity: 5 weapons (Storage Facility Level 0)
- Maximum capacity: 55 weapons (Storage Facility Level 10)
- Storage includes both equipped and unequipped weapons

**Facility Discount: Weapons Workshop**
- Provides 5% to 50% discount based on level
- Formula:
  ```
  discount = weapons_workshop_level × 5  // 0% to 50%
  weapon_cost = base_price × (1 - discount/100)
  ```

**Examples**:
- Plasma Cannon (₡300,000) with Workshop Level 5:
  - Discount: 25%
  - Final cost: ₡300,000 × 0.75 = ₡225,000

### 4. Weapon Crafting (Unlockable)

**Requirements**:
- Weapons Workshop Level 3+ (unlocks weapon modifications)
- Weapons Workshop Level 6+ (unlocks custom weapon design)
- Weapons Workshop Level 10 (unlocks legendary weapon crafting)
- 10+ battles with similar weapon types
- Minimum 5,000 prestige

**Crafting Costs** (Aligned with catalog weapon pricing):
- Base weapon template: ₡50,000
- Attribute bonus allocation: ₡15,000-₡20,000 per +1 attribute point
- Maximum attribute point budget: 20 points for Level 6, 25 points for Level 10
- Special properties: **Future feature** (not yet implemented in battle system)

**Example Custom Weapon** (Workshop Level 6):
- Base template: ₡50,000
- +15 attribute points: 15 × ₡17,000 = ₡255,000
- **Total**: ₡305,000 (comparable to Plasma Cannon at ₡300,000)

**Example Legendary Weapon** (Workshop Level 10):
- Base template: ₡50,000
- +25 attribute points: 25 × ₡17,000 = ₡425,000
- **Total**: ₡475,000 (premium tier, beyond catalog weapons)

**Note**: Custom weapons use the same pricing formula as catalog weapons. The 11 catalog weapons serve as reference examples that could be crafted using this system. Special properties (e.g., "ignores armor", "shield drain") will be added in future phases when implemented in the battle system. 

### 5. Repair Costs

**Base Formula**:
```
base_repair = (sum_of_all_23_attributes × 100)
damage_percentage = damage_taken / max_hp

// Apply multiplier based on condition
if robot_destroyed (HP = 0):
    multiplier = 2.0
elif robot_heavily_damaged (HP < 10%):
    multiplier = 1.5
else:
    multiplier = 1.0

repair_cost_before_discounts = base_repair × damage_percentage × multiplier
```

**Facility Discounts**:

1. **Repair Bay** (all repairs):
   - Discount: 5% to 50% (Level 1-10)
   - Formula: `discount = repair_bay_level × 5%`

2. **Medical Bay** (critical damage only, HP = 0):
   - Reduces critical damage multiplier (2.0x) by 10%-100%
   - Formula: `effective_multiplier = 2.0 × (1 - medical_bay_level × 0.1)`
   - Level 10: Eliminates critical damage penalty entirely

**Repair Bay ROI Analysis**:
- Average robot (230 total attributes): Base repair cost = ₡23,000
- Average damage per battle: 40-60% HP (₡9,200-₡13,800 repair cost)
- **Repair Bay Level 1** (₡200K, 5% discount):
  - Saves ₡460-₡690 per battle
  - Payback: 290-435 battles
  - At 7 battles/week: **41-62 weeks** to break even
- **Repair Bay Level 5** (₡1M total, 25% discount):
  - Saves ₡2,300-₡3,450 per battle
  - Incremental cost from Level 1: ₡800K
  - Payback for incremental investment: 232-348 battles (**33-50 weeks**)

**Conclusion**: Repair Bay provides long-term value but requires sustained play to recoup investment. Most beneficial for players with multiple robots or those planning long-term engagement.

**Final Repair Cost Formula**:
```
// Step 1: Calculate base repair with multiplier
base_repair = sum_of_attributes × 100
repair_before_discounts = base_repair × damage_percentage × condition_multiplier

// Step 2: Apply Medical Bay if critical damage
if HP = 0 AND medical_bay_level > 0:
    medical_reduction = medical_bay_level × 0.1
    effective_multiplier = 2.0 × (1 - medical_reduction)
    repair_before_discounts = base_repair × damage_percentage × effective_multiplier

// Step 3: Apply Repair Bay discount
repair_bay_discount = repair_bay_level × 0.05
final_repair_cost = repair_before_discounts × (1 - repair_bay_discount)
```

**Example**:
- Robot with 230 total attributes (sum of all 23)
- Started battle with 100 HP
- Took 100 damage during battle (reduced to 0 HP = destroyed)
- Repair Bay Level 5, Medical Bay Level 3

```
base_repair = 230 × 100 = ₡23,000
damage_percentage = 100/100 = 1.0  // 100% damage (complete destruction)

// Critical damage multiplier with Medical Bay
medical_reduction = 3 × 0.1 = 0.3
effective_multiplier = 2.0 × (1 - 0.3) = 1.4

repair_before_discount = 23,000 × 1.0 × 1.4 = ₡32,200

// Repair Bay discount
repair_bay_discount = 5 × 0.05 = 0.25
final_repair_cost = 32,200 × (1 - 0.25) = ₡24,150
```

**Repair Timing**:
- Repairs must be paid between battles to restore robot to full HP
- Robot cannot participate in next battle until repaired
- HP does NOT regenerate automatically (must pay repair cost)
- Energy shields regenerate automatically between battles (no cost)

### 6. Operating Costs (Daily Recurring)

**Facility Operating Costs**:
Each facility has daily operating cost that scales with level.

**Formula** (varies by facility):
```
// Most facilities:
operating_cost = base_cost + (additional_cost × level)

// Examples:
Repair Bay: ₡1,000 + (₡500 × level)
Training Facility: ₡1,500 + (₡750 × level)
Research Lab: ₡2,000 + (₡1,000 × level)
```

**Special Cases**:
- **Roster Expansion**: ₡500/day per robot slot beyond first (first slot is free)
  - Level 0: 1 robot slot (free, ₡0/day operating cost)
  - Level 1: 2 robot slots (₡500/day total - ₡500 for the 2nd slot)
  - Level 2: 3 robot slots (₡1,000/day total - ₡500 each for 2nd and 3rd slots)
  - Formula: `operating_cost = (current_roster_size - 1) × ₡500/day`
- **Coaching Staff**: ₡3,000/day when coach is active (only if Coaching Staff facility purchased)
- **Booking Office**: ₡0/day (generates prestige instead)

**Typical Daily Operating Costs by Game Stage**:
- **Early Game** (1 robot, 1-2 facilities): ₡2,500-₡5,000/day
- **Mid Game** (3-4 robots, 4-6 facilities): ₡15,000-₡25,000/day
- **Late Game** (6-10 robots, 10+ facilities): ₡40,000-₡60,000/day

**Note**: Early game players should prioritize attribute upgrades over multiple facilities. With only 1 robot, Storage Facility and Roster Expansion provide no benefit. **Recommended early facilities**: Repair Bay (long-term savings) and optionally one Academy (if pushing past level 10 cap). 

### 7. Coach Switching Cost

- **One-time cost**: ₡100,000 to switch active coach
- Only applies if Coaching Staff facility is purchased
- Coach daily operating cost: ₡3,000/day while active

### 8. Total Startup Costs

**Player Behavior Reality**: Most players will spend nearly all starting credits to maximize immediate robot power, keeping only minimal buffer (₡10K-₡50K) for first repairs. The game should accommodate this behavior.

**Minimum Viable Stable** (₡1,950,000 spent, ₡50K buffer):
- 1 Robot: ₡500,000
- 1 Budget weapon (e.g., Practice Sword or Machine Gun): ₡50,000-₡100,000
- Repair Bay Level 1: ₡200,000
- Basic attribute upgrades (100 levels @ avg ₡550): ~₡55,000
- One Academy Level 1 (e.g., Combat Training): ₡400,000
- Additional attribute upgrades (100 levels): ~₡650,000
- **Buffer**: ₡50,000 (1-2 repairs)

**Balanced Startup** (₡1,970,000 spent, ₡30K buffer - recommended):
- 1 Robot: ₡500,000
- 1 Mid-tier weapon (e.g., Power Sword): ₡200,000
- Repair Bay Level 1: ₡200,000
- Training Facility Level 1: ₡300,000
- Attribute upgrades focused on key stats (150 levels): ~₡770,000
- **Buffer**: ₡30,000 (1 repair)

**Aggressive Startup** (₡1,985,000 spent, ₡15K buffer - risky):
- 2 Robots: ₡1,000,000
- 2 Budget weapons (e.g., 2× Machine Guns): ₡200,000
- Repair Bay Level 1: ₡200,000
- Split attribute upgrades (100 levels total): ~₡585,000
- **Buffer**: ₡15,000 (emergency only)

**Power Maximizer** (₡1,995,000 spent, ₡5K buffer - very risky):
- 1 Robot: ₡500,000
- 1 Premium weapon (e.g., Plasma Cannon): ₡400,000
- Repair Bay Level 1: ₡200,000
- Heavy attribute investment (200 levels): ~₡895,000
- **Buffer**: ₡5,000 (forced to win first battle or bankrupt)

**Economic Safeguards Needed**:
1. **Low balance warnings**: Alert when balance < ₡100K (before battle matchmaking)
2. **Battle entry check**: Require minimum balance equal to estimated repair cost (prevent bankruptcy from battle)
3. **Emergency credit line**: Allow players to take small loan (₡50K-₡100K) at 20% interest if they fall below ₡10K
4. **First battle protection**: First 5 battles have reduced repair costs (50% discount) to prevent early bankruptcy

**Design Note**: The ₡2M starting balance intentionally forces players to make strategic trade-offs. They cannot afford everything - they must choose between:
- More robots vs. better weapons vs. facilities vs. attribute upgrades
- Immediate power vs. long-term infrastructure
- Offense-focused vs. balanced builds

| Platinum | ₡40,000 - ₡80,000 | +30 | +30 |
| Diamond | ₡80,000 - ₡150,000 | +50 | +50 |
| Champion | ₡150,000 - ₡300,000 | +75 | +75 |

**Fame vs Prestige**:
- **Fame**: Robot-level reputation (individual robot stat)
- **Prestige**: Stable-level reputation (account-wide stat)
- Both earned from victories but tracked separately
- Fame used for robot rankings; Prestige unlocks stable content

**Battle Reward Formula**:
```
// Winner reward - base determined by league tier
winner_base_reward = league_base + (ELO_difference_bonus)

// ELO difference bonus (for winners only)
if opponent_ELO > your_ELO:
    ELO_bonus = (opponent_ELO - your_ELO) / 20  // Upset bonus
else:
    ELO_bonus = 0

// Final winner reward (before prestige multiplier)
winner_reward = min(winner_base_reward + ELO_bonus, league_max)

// Participation reward (both winner and loser receive this)
participation_reward = league_base × 0.3  // 30% of league base

// Example: Bronze league (₡5K-₡10K range)
// Winner: Your ELO: 1150, Opponent ELO: 1250
// winner_base = ₡5,000
// ELO_bonus = (1250-1150)/20 = ₡5,000
// winner_reward = min(₡10,000, ₡10,000) = ₡10,000 (max for Bronze)
// participation = ₡5,000 × 0.3 = ₡1,500
// WINNER TOTAL = ₡10,000 + ₡1,500 = ₡11,500

// Loser: Same battle
// loser_reward = ₡0 (no win bonus)
// participation = ₡1,500
// LOSER TOTAL = ₡1,500
```

**Participation Award System**:
- **Amount**: 30% of league base reward (both winner and loser)
- **Purpose**: Offset repair costs, especially for losers who take more damage
- **Balance**: Ensures losing players still earn some credits to cover basic repairs

**League-Specific Participation Rewards**:
- Bronze league: ₡1,500 (30% of ₡5,000 base)
- Silver league: ₡3,000 (30% of ₡10,000 base)
- Gold league: ₡6,000 (30% of ₡20,000 base)
- Platinum league: ₡12,000 (30% of ₡40,000 base)
- Diamond league: ₡24,000 (30% of ₡80,000 base)
- Champion league: ₡45,000 (30% of ₡150,000 base)

**Economic Impact with Participation Awards**:
- **Winner** (Bronze): ₡7,500 win reward + ₡1,500 participation = ₡9,000 total
- **Loser** (Bronze): ₡0 win reward + ₡1,500 participation = ₡1,500 total
- **At 50% win rate** (3.5 wins, 3.5 losses per week):
  - Income: (3.5 × ₡9,000) + (3.5 × ₡1,500) = ₡31,500 + ₡5,250 = ₡36,750/week
  - Repair costs (winner damage ~₡5K, loser damage ~₡12K): 
    - Winners: 3.5 × ₡5,000 = ₡17,500
    - Losers: 3.5 × ₡12,000 = ₡42,000
    - Total: ₡59,500/week
  - **Net**: ₡36,750 - ₡59,500 = -₡22,750/week shortfall
  
**Repair Cost Adjustment Needed**:
To achieve sustainability at 50% win rate with participation awards:
- Target: Income (₡36,750) should cover 90% of repair costs
- Target repair costs: ₡40,833/week (₡36,750 / 0.9)
- Current repair costs: ₡59,500/week
- **Required reduction**: 31% lower repair costs

**Recommended Solution**:
1. **Add participation awards** (implemented above): +₡10,500/week income boost
2. **Reduce base repair formula**: `(total_attributes × 75)` instead of `(total_attributes × 100)` = 25% cost reduction
3. **New repair costs**: ₡44,625/week (₡59,500 × 0.75)
4. **New economics**: ₡36,750 income covers 82% of ₡44,625 repairs
5. **Gap**: ₡7,875/week deficit - covered by facility income streams (merchandising, streaming) or reduced operating costs 

### 2. Prestige Bonuses (Battle Multiplier)

> **For complete prestige earning mechanics**, see [PRD_PRESTIGE_AND_FAME.md](PRD_PRESTIGE_AND_FAME.md)

Higher stable prestige increases battle winnings:

| Prestige Threshold | Battle Winnings Bonus |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| 5,000+ | +5% |
| 10,000+ | +10% |
| 25,000+ | +15% |
| 50,000+ | +20% |

**Bonus Application**: Prestige bonus multiplies the base battle reward **AFTER** ELO calculation, extending beyond the league reward range.

**Prestige Accumulation Timeline**:
- Starting prestige: 0
- Bronze wins (+5 prestige each): 1,000 wins needed for 5,000 prestige threshold
- Average player (50% win rate, 7 battles/week): 3.5 wins/week = ~285 weeks (5.5 years)
- **More realistic**: Mix of leagues + achievements + tournaments
  - Bronze: 100 wins = +500 prestige
  - Silver: 100 wins = +1,000 prestige  
  - Gold: 50 wins = +1,000 prestige
  - Achievements: ~1,000 prestige
  - Tournaments: ~500 prestige
  - **Total to 5,000**: ~6-12 months of regular play

**"Win More" Concern**: 
- Yes, prestige rewards successful players with better rewards
- Counterbalance: ELO matchmaking ensures ~50% win rate long-term
- Benefit: Rewards player loyalty and continued engagement
- Alternative: Prestige could reduce operating costs instead of increasing income

**Formula**:
```
prestige_multiplier = 1.0

if prestige >= 50000:
    prestige_multiplier = 1.20
elif prestige >= 25000:
    prestige_multiplier = 1.15
elif prestige >= 10000:
    prestige_multiplier = 1.10
elif prestige >= 5000:
    prestige_multiplier = 1.05

final_battle_reward = base_reward × prestige_multiplier
```

**Example**:
- Bronze league win: ₡7,500 base (midpoint of ₡5K-₡10K range)
- Prestige: 12,000
- Multiplier: +10%
- Final reward: ₡7,500 × 1.10 = ₡8,250
- **Note**: Base reward midpoint is determined by ELO matchup. Closer matches → higher base (closer to ₡10K). Mismatched opponents → lower base (closer to ₡5K).

### 3. Merchandising Income (Income Generator Facility)

> **For complete prestige earning and benefits**, see [PRD_PRESTIGE_AND_FAME.md](PRD_PRESTIGE_AND_FAME.md)

**Requirements**:
- Income Generator Level 1+ (unlocks merchandising)

**Base Income by Level**:
- Level 1: ₡5,000/day
- Level 2: ₡8,000/day
- Level 4: ₡12,000/day
- Level 6: ₡18,000/day
- Level 8: ₡25,000/day
- Level 10: ₡35,000/day

**Scaling Formula**:
```
base_merchandising = income_generator_base_rate  // Based on level
prestige_multiplier = 1 + (stable_prestige / 10000)

merchandising_income = base_merchandising × prestige_multiplier
```

**Design Rationale**: Merchandising scales with **stable prestige** (not individual robot fame) because it represents the stable's overall brand value and reputation. Higher prestige stables can charge more for merchandise and attract more fans.

**Examples**:
*Early Game (Low Prestige):*
- Income Generator Level 1: ₡5,000/day base
- Stable prestige: 1,000
- Prestige multiplier: 1 + (1000/10000) = 1.1
- Daily income: ₡5,000 × 1.1 = ₡5,500/day
- Operating cost: ₡1,000/day
- **Net**: ₡4,500/day

*Mid Game (Moderate Prestige):*
- Income Generator Level 4: ₡12,000/day base
- Stable prestige: 15,000
- Prestige multiplier: 1 + (15000/10000) = 2.5
- Daily income: ₡12,000 × 2.5 = ₡30,000/day
- Operating cost: ₡3,000/day
- **Net**: ₡27,000/day

*Late Game (High Prestige):*
- Income Generator Level 10: ₡35,000/day base
- Stable prestige: 50,000
- Prestige multiplier: 1 + (50000/10000) = 6.0
- Daily income: ₡35,000 × 6.0 = ₡210,000/day
- Operating cost: ₡5,500/day
- **Net**: ₡204,500/day

**Operating Cost**: ₡1,000/day at Level 1, +₡500/day per level

**Design Note**: Prestige-based scaling rewards long-term player engagement and success across all robots in the stable.

### 4. Streaming Revenue (Income Generator Facility)

> **For complete fame earning and benefits**, see [PRD_PRESTIGE_AND_FAME.md](PRD_PRESTIGE_AND_FAME.md)

**Requirements**:
- Income Generator Level 3+ (unlocks streaming)

**Base Income by Level**:
- Level 3: ₡3,000/day
- Level 5: ₡6,000/day
- Level 7: ₡10,000/day
- Level 9: ₡15,000/day
- Level 10: ₡22,000/day

**Scaling Formula**:
```
base_streaming = income_generator_streaming_rate  // Based on level
battle_multiplier = 1 + (total_battles / 1000)  // Aggregate across ALL robots
fame_multiplier = 1 + (total_fame / 5000)  // Sum of ALL robot fame values

streaming_income = base_streaming × battle_multiplier × fame_multiplier
```

**Design Rationale**: Streaming scales with **aggregate battle count and total fame** across all robots because viewers watch the entire stable's content. More robots = more battles = more content = higher streaming revenue.

**Examples**:
*Single Robot (early game):*
- Income Generator Level 3: ₡3,000/day base
- Total battles (1 robot): 250
- Total fame (1 robot): 1,250
- Battle multiplier: 1 + (250/1000) = 1.25
- Fame multiplier: 1 + (1250/5000) = 1.25
- Daily income: ₡3,000 × 1.25 × 1.25 = ₡4,688/day

*Three Robots (mid game):*
- Income Generator Level 5: ₡6,000/day base
- Total battles: Robot 1 (500) + Robot 2 (300) + Robot 3 (100) = 900
- Total fame: Robot 1 (5,000) + Robot 2 (3,000) + Robot 3 (1,000) = 9,000
- Battle multiplier: 1 + (900/1000) = 1.9
- Fame multiplier: 1 + (9000/5000) = 2.8
- Daily income: ₡6,000 × 1.9 × 2.8 = ₡31,920/day

*Large Stable (late game):*
- Income Generator Level 10: ₡22,000/day base
- Total battles across 6 robots: 3,500
- Total fame across 6 robots: 25,000
- Battle multiplier: 1 + (3500/1000) = 4.5
- Fame multiplier: 1 + (25000/5000) = 6.0
- Daily income: ₡22,000 × 4.5 × 6.0 = ₡594,000/day

**Design Note**: Aggregate scaling strongly rewards multi-robot strategies and encourages building a roster of active, famous robots. Streaming income grows exponentially with stable size and activity.

## Economic Balance & Progression

### Early Game Economics (Days 1-30)

**Starting Budget**: ₡2,000,000

**Recommended Spending**:
- 1 Robot: ₡500,000
- 1 Good weapon: ₡150,000-₡300,000
- Repair Bay Level 1: ₡200,000
- Training Facility Level 1: ₡300,000 (optional but recommended)
- Attribute upgrades: ₡300,000-₡500,000
- Reserve for operations: ₡500,000

**Income Sources**:
- Bronze/Silver league battles: ₡5,000-₡15,000 per win
- **Battle frequency**: 1 battle per robot per day (7 battles/week)
- Expected wins at 50% win rate: 3.5 wins/week
- Weekly income: 3.5 × ₡8,000 avg = **₡28,000/week** (₡4,000/day)

**Operating Costs**:
- Repair Bay Level 1: ₡1,000/day
- Repairs (7 battles at avg ₡3,500): ₡24,500/week (₡3,500/day)
- **Daily total**: ~₡4,500/day

**Net Result**: Slight profit with 50% win rate (~₡3,500/week surplus)

**Balance Verification** (50% win rate profitability):
- Daily income: ₡4,000 (from 0.5 wins/day)
- Daily costs: ₡4,500 (₡1K facility + ₡3.5K repairs)
- **Shortfall**: -₡500/day (-₡3,500/week)
- **Coverage**: 89% (close to target 90%)

**Note**: Values assume revised repair cost formula (attributes × 50) or participation rewards. With current formula (attributes × 100), early game is not sustainable at 50% win rate without reducing repair costs or increasing battle rewards. 

### Mid Game Economics (Days 30-120)

**Typical Balance**: ₡3M-₡8M accumulated

**Investment Strategy**:
- Expand to 3-4 robots: ₡1,500,000-₡2,000,000
- Upgrade key facilities to Level 3-5: ₡2,000,000-₡4,000,000
- Purchase premium weapons: ₡800,000-₡1,500,000
- Unlock Income Generator: ₡800,000 (provides passive income)

**Income Sources**:

- 6-10 robot roster: ₡3,000,000-₡5,000,000
- Premium weapon collection: ₡3,000,000-₡5,000,000
- Custom weapon crafting: ₡1,000,000-₡3,000,000 per weapon
- Prestige-locked content: Access to highest tournaments

**Income Sources**:
- Diamond/Champion league battles: ₡80,000-₡250,000 per win
- High-prestige multiplier: +15-20% on all winnings
- Merchandising income: ₡40,000-₡80,000/day
- Streaming income: ₡30,000-₡60,000/day
- Tournament winnings: ₡500,000-₡2,000,000 (weekly)
- **Total**: ₡150,000-₡400,000/day

**Operating Costs**:
- Facilities: ₡40,000-₡60,000/day
- Repairs: ₡20,000-₡50,000 per battle
- Daily total: ~₡50,000-₡80,000/day

**Net Result**: Highly profitable, focus on optimization and prestige

### Facility Investment ROI

**Payback Period Examples** (Revised with correct battle frequency):

1. **Repair Bay Level 1** (₡200,000):
   - Saves ~5% on repairs (₡175 per battle with ₡3,500 avg repair)
   - **Battle frequency**: 7 battles/week per robot
   - Payback: 1,143 battles ÷ 7 = **163 weeks** (3.1 years)
   - **Multi-robot benefit**: With 3 robots, 21 battles/week → **54 weeks** (1 year)
   - **Conclusion**: Better value with multiple robots or as long-term investment
  
2. **Training Facility Level 1** (₡300,000):
   - Saves 5% on upgrades (varies: ₡2K-₡50K saved depending on level)
   - Example: Upgrading 1→10 saves ₡2,700 per attribute (₡54K × 5%)
   - For 23 attributes (1→10): Saves ₡62,100
   - **Payback**: Would need to upgrade ~5 robots from 1→10
   - **Best for**: Players planning multiple robots or high-level upgrades (15-50)
   - **Early game**: Not cost-effective (as calculated in section 1)
   
3. **Income Generator Level 1** (₡800,000):
   - **Merchandising**: ₡5,000/day base - ₡1,000 operating cost = ₡4,000 net/day
   - Scales with prestige: At 10K prestige → ₡5,000 × 2.0 = ₡10,000/day (₡9,000 net)
   - **Base payback**: 200 days (with no prestige scaling)
   - **Realistic payback** (moderate prestige): 89-100 days
   - **With high prestige** (50K): 40-50 days
   - **Streaming** (Level 3+): Additional ₡3,000-₡6,000/day base (scales with battles/fame)
   - **Combined assessment**: Strong mid-game investment, scales well with prestige
   - **Recommendation**: Purchase when prestige reaches 5,000-10,000 range
   
4. **Weapons Workshop Level 1** (₡250,000):
   - Saves 5% on weapons (₡5K-₡20K per weapon)
   - Average weapon cost: ₡200K → saves ₡10K per purchase
   - Payback: **25 weapon purchases**
   - **Multi-robot context**: 3 robots × 2 weapons = 6 weapons minimum
   - With loadout changes/testing: 10-15 weapons over time
   - **Payback timeline**: **2-3 years** for typical player
   - **Conclusion**: Low priority unless frequently experimenting with weapons or running 4+ robots

**General Rule**: 
- **Discount facilities** require high usage frequency or multiple robots to justify
- **Income facilities** scale with stable prestige and robot activity (battles/fame aggregates)
- **Academy facilities** provide immediate benefit (cap unlock) beyond long-term savings

**Early Game Priority**:
1. **Repair Bay** - Only if planning 2+ robots soon
2. **One Academy** - Only if stuck at level 10 cap in key attributes
3. **Skip Income Generator** - Requires prestige to be effective
4. **Focus on robot power first** - Attributes and weapons
