## Comparison to Other Facilities

### Training Facility vs Repair Bay
- **Training Facility**: Predictable savings, scales with upgrade spending
- **Repair Bay**: Variable savings, scales with battle frequency and robot count
- **Recommendation**: Buy Training Facility first for 1-2 robot strategies

### Training Facility vs Merchandising Hub
- **Training Facility**: Saves money on upgrades (reduces costs)
- **Merchandising Hub**: Generates passive income (adds revenue)
- **Recommendation**: Both are viable early-game investments

### Training Facility vs Weapons Workshop
- **Training Facility**: More valuable (upgrades are ongoing expense)
- **Weapons Workshop**: Less valuable (weapons are one-time purchases)
- **Recommendation**: Prioritize Training Facility

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Player, 1 Robot, Bronze League

- Upgrade spending: ₡50,000/day (pushing to level 30+)
- Should I upgrade to Training Facility L5?

**Analysis:**
- Current savings (L3): ₡50,000 × 0.30 = ₡15,000/day
- New savings (L5): ₡50,000 × 0.50 = ₡25,000/day
- Additional savings: +₡10,000/day
- Additional operating cost: +₡500/day (₡1,250 - ₡750)

## Design Philosophy

This rebalance aligns Training Facility with the game's economic philosophy:

1. **Meaningful Early-Game Choices**: Players can now invest in Training Facility early without it being a trap
2. **Multiple Viable Paths**: Both 1-robot and 2-robot strategies benefit appropriately
3. **Sustainable Operations**: Operating costs are reasonable relative to income
4. **Long-Term Value**: Facility continues to provide value throughout the game
5. **Clear Break-Even**: Players can easily calculate if the investment makes sense

The old economics punished players for making what seemed like a logical investment. The new economics reward strategic planning while remaining accessible to new players.
