# Armoured Souls - Planning Questions

This document contains remaining questions that need to be answered to refine our development roadmap and make informed implementation decisions.

**Note**: Core design questions have been answered and documented in GAME_DESIGN.md. This document contains follow-up questions, implementation details, and documentation inconsistencies identified during review.

**Last Updated**: January 24, 2026  
**Current Phase**: Phase 0 Complete, Ready to Start Phase 1 (Local Prototype)

## 📋 DOCUMENTATION INCONSISTENCIES FOUND (January 24, 2026)

The following inconsistencies were discovered during documentation review and need clarification before proceeding:

### 1. Technology Stack - Framework Decision
**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Documents**: ARCHITECTURE.md vs SUMMARY.md, GAME_DESIGN.md, ROADMAP.md

- **Issue**: ARCHITECTURE.md (Lines 75-78) lists "Express or Fastify (TBD based on performance needs)" as undecided
- **Conflict**: SUMMARY.md states tech stack is "FINALIZED: Node.js + TypeScript + React"
- **Question**: Has the backend framework been decided? Should we update ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect Express or Fastify as the chosen framework?
- **Impact**: Blocks Phase 1 initialization

### 2. Real-time Features vs Batch Processing
**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Documents**: ARCHITECTURE.md vs MODULE_STRUCTURE.md vs PORTABILITY.md

- **Issue**: ARCHITECTURE.md says "Real-time: ❌ Not needed (scheduled batch battle processing)"
- **Conflict**: MODULE_STRUCTURE.md mentions "WebSockets for real-time updates" and PORTABILITY.md references "Web Push API"
- **Question**: Are real-time features needed for notifications/updates, or is everything truly async/scheduled? What specifically needs real-time vs what can be polled?
- **Impact**: Affects architecture decisions and technology choices

### 3. Phase Numbering and Structure
**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Documents**: MODULE_STRUCTURE.md vs ROADMAP.md

- **Issue**: MODULE_STRUCTURE.md defines "Phase 1-5" focusing on module development order
- **Conflict**: ROADMAP.md defines "Phase 0-9" focusing on feature completion and deployment
- **Question**: Should we use different terminology (e.g., "Module Phases" vs "Project Phases") or consolidate to one phasing system?
- **Impact**: Could cause confusion in planning and communication

### 4. Database Migration Tool
**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Documents**: MODULE_STRUCTURE.md

- **Issue**: References "Flyway, Alembic" for migrations - Flyway is Java-based, Alembic is Python-based
- **Conflict**: Using Node.js/TypeScript stack, should use TypeORM or Prisma migrations
- **Question**: Which ORM and migration tool will be used? TypeORM or Prisma?
- **Impact**: Affects Phase 1 database setup

### 5. Battle Processing Schedule for MVP
**Status**: 🟡 NEEDS SPECIFICATION  
**Documents**: GAME_DESIGN.md, ARCHITECTURE.md

- **Issue**: Multiple options mentioned (1-2 times daily, 4-6 times daily, etc.) but no clear MVP decision
- **Question**: What is the specific battle processing schedule for the MVP/Phase 1 prototype?
  - Once per day at specific time?
  - Multiple times per day (how many)?
  - Manual trigger for prototype?
- **Impact**: Affects prototype implementation and testing

### 6. Authentication Approach for Prototype
**Status**: 🟡 CLARIFICATION HELPFUL  
**Documents**: PHASE1_PLAN.md vs GAME_DESIGN.md vs SECURITY.md

- **Issue**: Prototype plan says "hardcode test user" or "basic auth", but final game requires OAuth
- **Question**: For Phase 1 prototype:
  - Should we implement basic username/password to test the flow?
  - Or truly hardcode a single test user to save time?
  - Or implement OAuth from the start?
- **Impact**: Affects Phase 1 scope and development time

### 7. Documentation Dates Inconsistent
**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS UPDATE  
**Documents**: Multiple files

- **Issue**: Last updated dates are inconsistent:
  - SUMMARY.md: "January 2024" (very outdated)
  - ROADMAP.md: "January 21, 2026" (3 days ago)
  - QUESTIONS.md: "January 2026" (no specific date)
- **Question**: Should we standardize all documentation dates to January 24, 2026?
- **Impact**: Minor - documentation clarity only

### 8. Current Project Status
**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS ALIGNMENT  
**Documents**: SUMMARY.md vs ROADMAP.md

- **Issue**: SUMMARY.md says "Status: Awaiting Design Decisions & Tech Stack Selection"
- **Conflict**: ROADMAP.md shows decisions are complete and "Phase 1 Ready to Start"
- **Question**: What is the actual current status? Are we truly ready for Phase 1, or are there pending decisions?
- **Impact**: Affects whether we can start implementation

### 9. UI Component Library Choice
**Status**: 🟡 NEEDS DECISION  
**Documents**: ARCHITECTURE.md, PORTABILITY.md

- **Issue**: ARCHITECTURE.md (Line 86) lists "Material-UI or Tailwind CSS (TBD)"
- **Question**: Has this been decided for the prototype? Or should prototype use basic HTML/CSS?
- **Impact**: Affects Phase 1 UI implementation approach

### 10. Monorepo Structure Timeline
**Status**: 🟡 NEEDS CLARIFICATION  
**Documents**: PORTABILITY.md vs ROADMAP.md

- **Issue**: PORTABILITY.md describes monorepo structure in detail
- **Question**: When should monorepo structure be implemented?
  - Phase 1 prototype (overkill?)
  - Phase 2 (before mobile)?
  - Phase 6 (when starting mobile)?
- **Impact**: Affects initial project structure decisions

## Summary: What's Blocking Phase 1 Start?

### CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Resolve First)
1. ⚠️ **Backend Framework**: Express or Fastify?
2. ⚠️ **ORM Tool**: TypeORM or Prisma?
3. ⚠️ **Status Confirmation**: Is Phase 0 truly complete and ready for Phase 1?

### RECOMMENDED (Should Clarify Soon)
4. 🟡 **Battle Schedule**: Once per day? Multiple times? Manual trigger?
5. 🟡 **Auth Approach**: Hardcode, basic auth, or full OAuth for prototype?

### MINOR (Can Decide During Development)
6. 🟢 **UI Library**: Material-UI, Tailwind, or bare-bones?
7. 🟢 **Real-time Strategy**: WebSockets for notifications, or pure batch?

---

## Questions for Robert

Before proceeding with Phase 1 implementation, please provide guidance on:

### 1. Critical Decisions (Must Answer)
- **Backend Framework**: Should we use Express (more familiar, larger ecosystem) or Fastify (better performance)? I recommend **Express** for simplicity.
- **ORM/Migrations**: Should we use TypeORM or Prisma? I recommend **Prisma** (better TypeScript support, easier migrations).
- **Ready for Phase 1?**: Confirm we have everything needed to start implementation.

### 2. High Priority (Should Answer)
- **Battle Schedule**: For the prototype, should battles run:
  - On-demand/manual trigger (simplest for testing)?
  - Once per day at a set time?
  - Multiple times per day?
- **Prototype Authentication**: Should we:
  - Hardcode a single test user (fastest)?
  - Implement basic username/password (tests the flow)?
  - Implement OAuth from start (more work but production-ready)?

### 3. Clarifications Helpful
- **Real-time Features**: Are notifications/updates truly batch-only, or do we need WebSockets for anything?
- **Phase Naming**: Should we rename "Module Phases" to avoid confusion with "Project Phases"?
- **UI Component Library**: Should prototype use a component library (faster, prettier) or basic HTML/CSS (simpler, no dependencies)?

## Additional Questions Before Building Prototype

Beyond the inconsistencies found, here are additional clarifications that would help:

### Development Process
1. **Time Commitment**: How many hours per week can you dedicate to this project?
   - Affects whether 4-8 week timeline is realistic
2. **Development Style**: Do you prefer:
   - Pair programming style (work together in real-time)?
   - Async style (I build, you review)?
   - Hybrid?

### Prototype Testing
3. **Friend Group Size**: How many friends will test the prototype?
   - Affects whether we need multiple simultaneous battles
4. **Feedback Goals**: What's the main question you want answered?
   - "Is the core concept fun?"
   - "Are the mechanics balanced?"
   - "Is the UI intuitive?"
   - All of the above?

### Technical Preferences
5. **Learning vs Speed**: Would you rather:
   - Use familiar tools to move faster?
   - Learn new tools that might be better long-term?
6. **IDE/Editor**: What development environment do you use?
   - VS Code, WebStorm, other?
   - Helps ensure setup instructions are clear

### Scope Flexibility
7. **Must-Have for Demo**: What absolutely must work for the prototype demo?
   - Robot creation?
   - Battle simulation?
   - Battle results viewing?
   - All of the above?
8. **Nice-to-Have**: What can we skip if we run short on time?
   - Battle replay visualization?
   - Robot comparison tools?
   - Battle history?
