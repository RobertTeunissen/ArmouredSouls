# Armoured Souls — Logo Geometry & Construction (Step 2A)

## Purpose
This document defines the **geometric, typographic, and spacing rules** for the Armoured Souls logo.

It ensures:
- All logo variants (B, C, D) share identical DNA
- No stylistic drift over time
- Predictable scalability across UI, marketing, and future platforms

This document is **authoritative**.  
Deviation requires an explicit brand decision.

## Typographic Base (Locked)

### Typeface Class
**Industrial Precision System**  
(DIN / DIN Next / Inter Tight–class, condensed industrial grotesk)

> Vendor font choice may vary, geometry may not.

### Weight
- Logo: **Bold / Heavy only**
- No light, regular, or variable interpolation allowed for logo assets

### Casing
- **ALL CAPS** for all logo wordmarks
- No mixed-case logo usage permitted

---

## Wordmark Structure

### Primary Wordmark
**ARMOURED SOULS**

- Two words, equal visual weight
- No hierarchy through size differences
- Hierarchy is implied through spacing only

### Subtitle (when used)
**ROBO BATTLE**

- Always secondary
- Reduced size (≈ 35–45% of main wordmark height)
- Positioned **above** the main wordmark
- Horizontally centered
- Never overlaps the main letterforms

---

## Proportional Geometry Rules

### Width Compression
- Target condensed ratio: **80–85%** of normal width
- Must feel efficient, not claustrophobic

### Vertical Rhythm
- Flat baseline
- No ascenders or descenders extending beyond the cap-height illusion
- Visual weight must feel grounded and stable

---

## Letterform Constraints (Critical)

### Allowed
- Straight terminals
- Angular joins
- Flat horizontal cuts
- Closed counters where applicable

### Forbidden
- Rounded terminals
- Decorative flares
- Stylised ligatures
- Script-like or calligraphic features

---

## Optical Corrections (Per-Letter Rules)

These letters require **manual adjustment** and must never rely on auto-kerning:

### A
- Apex must be optically lowered
- Inner counter must feel structural, not decorative

### R
- Leg angle must suggest motion without aggression
- Bowl-to-leg transition must remain mechanical

### S
- Must feel *engineered*, not fluid
- Avoid organic curvature

### D
- **Critical letter**
- Must feel solid and defensive
- Outer curve must not soften the wordmark

---

## Spacing & Kerning Rules

### Tracking
- Tight tracking is mandatory
- Target: visually compressed without collision

### Kerning
- Manual kerning only
- Auto-kerning is prohibited in final assets

### Word Separation
- Space between “ARMOURED” and “SOULS” equals:
  - approx. 1.25× internal letter spacing

---

## Alignment Rules

- Optical centering preferred over mathematical centering
- Subtitle aligns to visual center of main wordmark
- No skew, rotation, or perspective distortion allowed

---

## Directional Variants (Preview Constraints)

This document governs **geometry only**, but constrains future variants:

### Direction B — Core
- Geometry shown exactly as defined here
- Flat or brushed material only

### Direction C — Energised
- Geometry is **identical**
- Energy, glow, or light may exist **inside** the letterforms
- No outline distortion permitted

### Direction D — Minimal
- Geometry reduced, never redrawn
- Monogram or emblem must be extractable from this structure

---

## Scalability Requirements

The logo must remain legible at:
- 24px height (minimum)
- 40px height (standard UI)
- 400px+ (hero usage)

Any geometry failing this requirement is invalid.

---

## Prohibited Treatments

- Anime-style cuts or exaggeration
- Organic distortion
- Excessive beveling
- Explosive outer glows
- Grunge or damage textures

---

## Brand Integrity Rule

When modifying or extending the logo, ask:

> “Does this reinforce control, mastery, and deliberate ownership —  
> or does it introduce unnecessary expression?”

If it introduces expression without purpose, it is rejected.

---

## Status

**Geometry: LOCKED**  
Next step: execution of logo family based on this construction.
