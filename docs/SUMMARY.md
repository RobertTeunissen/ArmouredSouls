## 🎯 Key Insights & Recommendations

### Technology Stack Recommendations

**Backend (Choose One)**:
- **Node.js + TypeScript** (Recommended) - Best for web-to-mobile portability with React Native
- Python + FastAPI - Better for data science/AI integration
- Go - Best raw performance

**Frontend**:
- **React + TypeScript** (Recommended) - Enables code sharing with React Native
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Vite for build tooling

**Database**:
- **PostgreSQL** (Recommended) - Robust relational database
- **Redis** - Caching and real-time features

**Mobile**:
- **React Native** (Recommended) - 70-80% code reuse from web
- Expo for rapid development

### Module Development Priority

**Phase 1 (Foundation)**:
1. Database → Auth → API

**Phase 2 (Core Features)**:
2. Player → Robot → Stable

**Phase 3 (Gameplay)**:
3. Game Engine → Battle → Matchmaking

**Phase 4 (User Experience)**:
4. UI (Web) → Notifications
