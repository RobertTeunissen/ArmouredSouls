# Frontend Environment Variables
# =============================================================================
# Copy this file to .env and adjust values for your environment.
# Vite exposes variables prefixed with VITE_ to the client bundle at build time.
# See: https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# VITE_API_URL — Base URL for all API requests
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Used by the shared Axios API client (src/utils/apiClient.ts) as the baseURL.
#
# Development (local):
#   Leave empty or omit entirely. The Vite dev server proxy (configured in
#   vite.config.ts) forwards /api requests to http://localhost:3001.
#
# Production / Acceptance (deployed on VPS):
#   Leave empty. An empty string makes all API calls use relative paths
#   (e.g. /api/user/profile), which are routed through the Caddy reverse proxy
#   to the backend automatically. No absolute URL is needed.
#
# Custom backend URL (rare):
#   Set to a full URL if the backend is hosted on a different domain.
#   Example: VITE_API_URL=https://api.armouredsouls.com
#
VITE_API_URL=
