# tagTeamBattleModel.test.ts - NEEDS REFACTORING

## Issue
This test file uses the old Battle model schema with fields like:
- robot1FinalHP, robot2FinalHP
- robot1FinalShield, robot2FinalShield
- robot1DamageDealt, robot2DamageDealt
- robot1ELOBefore, robot2ELOBefore, robot1ELOAfter, robot2ELOAfter

These fields have been migrated to the BattleParticipant model as part of the schema refactoring.

Additionally, robot creation is missing the userId field (needs to be added back).

## Required Changes
The test needs to be refactored to:
1. Add userId back to robot.create() calls
2. Create BattleParticipant records instead of using old Battle fields
3. Use the new BattleParticipant structure for all test data
4. Follow the pattern in the migration docs: docs/migrations/BATTLEPARTICIPANT_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md

## Priority
Medium - Tests the tag team battle model which is important functionality.

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours to refactor all test cases to use the new schema.
