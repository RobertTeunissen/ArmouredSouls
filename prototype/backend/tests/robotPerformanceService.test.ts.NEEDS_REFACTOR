# robotPerformanceService.test.ts - NEEDS REFACTORING

## Issue
This test file uses the old Battle model schema with fields like:
- robot1RepairCost, robot2RepairCost
- robot1PrestigeAwarded, robot2PrestigeAwarded  
- robot1FameAwarded, robot2FameAwarded
- robot1FinalHP, robot2FinalHP
- robot1DamageDealt, robot2DamageDealt

These fields have been migrated to the BattleParticipant model as part of the schema refactoring.

## Required Changes
The test needs to be refactored to:
1. Create BattleParticipant records instead of using old Battle fields
2. Use the new BattleParticipant structure for all test data
3. Follow the pattern in the migration docs: docs/migrations/BATTLEPARTICIPANT_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md

## Priority
Medium - The robotPerformanceService itself has been migrated to use BattleParticipant,
but the tests haven't been updated yet.

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours to refactor all test cases to use the new schema.
