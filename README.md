# Armoured Souls

A next-generation strategy simulation game where thousands of players manage their own "stable" of battle robots in a persistent online world.

## 🎮 Project Vision

Armoured Souls is designed to be a highly scalable, secure, and portable multiplayer strategy game. Players will build, customize, and manage teams of battle robots, competing in various game modes and tournaments.

## 🎯 Core Principles

- **Fully Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage at all levels
- **Ultra Secure**: Security-first design with robust authentication and data protection
- **Portable**: Web-based initially, with iOS and Android support in future phases
- **Scalable**: Built to support thousands of concurrent players

## 📋 Project Status

**Current Phase**: Planning & Architecture  
**Status**: Setting up project scaffolding and documentation

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project is in the planning phase. We are currently focusing on architecture, documentation, and module design before diving into implementation.
